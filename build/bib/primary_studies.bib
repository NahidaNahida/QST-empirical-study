 abstract = {Given that quantum software testing is a new area of research, there is a lack of benchmark programs and bugs repositories to assess the effectiveness of testing techniques. To this end, quantum mutation analysis focuses on systematically generating faulty versions of Quantum Programs (QPs), called mutants, using mutation operators. Such mutants can be used as benchmarks to assess the quality of test cases in a test suite. Thus, we present Muskit - a quantum mutation analysis tool for QPs coded in IBM's Qiskit language. Muskit defines mutation operators on gates of QPs and selection criteria to reduce the number of mutants to generate. Moreover, it allows for the execution of test cases on mutants and generation of results for test analyses. Muskit is provided as command line interface, GUI, and web application. We validated Muskit by using it to generate and execute mutants for four QPs.

Towards this direction, we present a quantum software testing tool called Quito that can automatically generate test suites covering three coverage criteria defined on inputs and outputs of a quantum program coded in Qiskit, i.e., input coverage, output coverage, and input-output coverage. Quito also implements two types of test oracles based on program specifications, i.e., checking whether a quantum program produced a wrong output or checking a probabilistic test oracle with statistical test. We describe the architecture and methodology of the tool. We also validated the tool with one quantum program and one faulty version of it.

@inproceedings{ye2024quratest,
 abstract = {The recent fast development of quantum computers breaks several computation limitations that are difficult for conventional computers. Up to the present, although many approaches and tools have been proposed to test quantum programs, the fundamental features of quantum programs, i.e., magnitude, phase, and entanglement, have been largely overlooked, leading to limited fault detection capability and reduced testing effectiveness. To address this problem, we propose an automated testing framework named QURATEST, equipped with three test case generators (including two newly proposed techniques, UCNOT and IQFT in this paper, as well as one based on Random techniques) to test quantum programs. Overall, the proposed generators enable the generation of diverse test inputs by considering the quantum features of quantum programs. In the experiments, we perform an in-depth evaluation of QURATEST from three aspects: generated test case diversity, output coverage of the program under test, and fault detection capability. The results demonstrate the potential of our newly proposed techniques in that IQFT can generate the most diverse test cases regarding magnitude, phase, and entanglement, with 66% cell coverage. Comparatively, the Random approach only has 10% cell coverage. Regarding the evaluations of the output coverage, IQFT can achieve the highest output coverage in 70.2% (33 out of 47) of all quantum programs. In terms of fault detection, UCNOT outperforms the other two techniques. Specifically, the test cases generated by UCNOT have the best mutation score in 88.4% (23 out of 26) quantum programs.},

Compared to debugging classical programs, debugging quantum programs is difficult because programmers have limited ability to probe the internal states of quantum programs, those states are difficult to interpret even when observations exist, and programmers do not yet have guidelines for what to check for when building quantum programs. In this work, we present quantum program assertions based on statistical tests on classical observations. These allow programmers to decide if a quantum program state matches its expected value in one of classical, superposition, or entangled types of states. We extend an existing quantum programming language with the ability to specify quantum assertions, which our tool then checks in a quantum program simulator. We use these assertions to debug three benchmark quantum programs in factoring, search, and chemistry. We share what types of bugs are possible, and lay out a strategy for using quantum programming patterns to place assertions and prevent bugs.},

@article{li2020projectionbased,
 abstract = {In this paper, we propose Proq, a runtime assertion scheme for testing and debugging quantum programs on a quantum computer. The predicates in Proq are represented by projections (or equivalently, closed subspaces of the state space), following Birkhoff-von Neumann quantum logic. The satisfaction of a projection by a quantum state can be directly checked upon a small number of projective measurements rather than a large number of repeated executions. On the theory side, we rigorously prove that checking projection-based assertions can help locate bugs or statistically assure that the semantic function of the tested program is close to what we expect, for both exact and approximate quantum programs. On the practice side, we consider hardware constraints and introduce several techniques to transform the assertions, making them directly executable on the measurement-restricted quantum computers. We also propose to achieve simplified assertion implementation using local projection technique with soundness guaranteed. We compare Proq with existing quantum program assertions and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Proq by its applications to assert two sophisticated Quantum algorithms and subroutines, the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm and Shor’s algorithm.},

Qubits and their gates are susceptible to various types of errors. Due to limited numbers of qubits and high error rates, quantum error correction cannot be applied. Physical constraints of quantum hardware including the error rates are used to guide the design and the layout of quantum circuits. The error rates determine the selection of qubits and their operations. The resulting circuit is executed on the quantum computer.This study explores the risk of unexpected changes in the error rates of NISQ computers post-calibration. We show that unexpected changes in error rates can alter the output state of a quantum circuit. To detect these changes, we propose the insertion of test points into the quantum circuit to enable online monitoring of the physical qubit behavior. We utilize classical, superposition, and uncompute test points. Furthermore, we use a gate error coverage metric to assess the quality of the tests. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on different IBM quantum computers (IBM Q), in addition to a noisy simulation that shows the scalability of the proposed approach.},

@inproceedings{wang2022origin,
 abstract = {Mutation testing is often used for designing new tests, and involves changing a program in minor ways, which results in mutated versions of the program, i.e., mutants. An effective test suite should find faults (or kill mutants) with a minimum number of test cases, to save resources required for executing test cases. In this paper, in the context of mutation testing for quantum programs, we present a multi-objective and search-based approach (MutTG) to generate the minimum number of test cases killing as many mutants as possible. MutTG tries to estimate the likelihood that a mutant is equivalent, and uses this as a discount factor in the fitness definition to avoid keeping on trying to kill mutants that cannot be killed. We employed NSGA-II as the multi-objective search algorithm. Then, we compared MutTG with another version of the approach that does not use the discount factor in its fitness definition, and with random search (RS), over a set of open-source quantum programs and their mutants of varying complexity. Results show that the discount factor does indeed help in guiding the test generation, as the approach with the discount factor performs better than the one without it.},

@inproceedings{sato2024locating,
 abstract = {When a bug is detected by testing a quantum program on a quantum computer, we want to determine its location to fix it. To locate the bug, the quantum program is divided into several segments, and each segment is tested. However, to prepare a quantum state that is input to a segment, it is necessary to execute all the segments ahead of that segment in a quantum computer. This means that the cost of testing each segment depends on its location. We can also locate a buggy segment only if it is confirmed that there are no bugs in all segments ahead of that buggy segment. Since a quantum program is tested statistically on the basis of measurement results, there is a tradeoff between testing accuracy and cost. Although these characteristics are unique to quantum programs and complicate locating bugs, they have not been investigated. We suggest for the first time that these characteristics should be considered to efficiently locate bugs. We are also the first to propose a bug-locating method that takes these characteristics into account. The results from experiments indicate that the bug-locating cost, represented as the number of executed quantum gates, can be reduced with the proposed method compared with naive methods.},

 abstract = {Quantum Neural Network (QNN) combines the deep learning (DL) principle with the fundamental theory of quantum mechanics to achieve machine learning tasks with quantum acceleration. Recently, QNN systems have been found to manifest robustness issues similar to classical DL systems. There is an urgent need for ways to test their correctness and security. However, QNN systems differ significantly from traditional quantum software and classical DL systems, posing critical challenges for QNN testing. These challenges include the inapplicability of traditional quantum software testing methods to QNN systems due to differences in programming paradigms and decision logic representations, the dependence of quantum test sample generation on perturbation operators, and the absence of effective information in quantum neurons. In this article, we propose QuanTest, a quantum entanglement-guided adversarial testing framework to uncover potential erroneous behaviors in QNN systems. We design a quantum entanglement adequacy criterion to quantify the entanglement acquired by the input quantum states from the QNN system, along with two similarity metrics to measure the proximity of generated quantum adversarial examples to the original inputs. Subsequently, QuanTest formulates the problem of generating test inputs that maximize the quantum entanglement adequacy and capture incorrect behaviors of the QNN system as a joint optimization problem and solves it in a gradient-based manner to generate quantum adversarial examples. Experimental results demonstrate that QuanTest possesses the capability to capture erroneous behaviors in QNN systems (generating 67.48–96.05% more high-quality test samples than the random noise under the same perturbation size constraints). The entanglement-guided approach proves effective in adversarial testing, generating more adversarial examples (maximum increase reached 21.32%).},

@article{chen2024automatic,
 abstract = {Quantum circuit testing is essential for detecting potential faults in realistic quantum devices, while the testing process itself also suffers from the inexactness and unreliability of quantum operations. This article alleviates the issue by proposing a novel framework of automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) for robust testing of logical quantum circuits. We introduce the stabilizer projector decomposition (SPD) for representing the quantum test pattern and construct the test application (i.e., state preparation and measurement) using Clifford-only circuits, which are rather robust and efficient as evidenced in the fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, it is generally hard to generate SPDs due to the exponentially growing number of the stabilizer projectors. To circumvent this difficulty, we develop an SPD generation algorithm, as well as several acceleration techniques that can exploit both locality and sparsity in generating SPDs. The effectiveness of our algorithms are validated by (1) theoretical guarantees under reasonable conditions and (2) experimental results on commonly used benchmark circuits, such as Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), Quantum Volume (QV), and Bernstein-Vazirani (BV) in IBM Qiskit.},

@article{kang2024statistical,
 abstract = {We present a new technique for accelerating quantum program testing. Given a quantum circuit with an input/output specification, our goal is to check whether executing the program on the input state produces the expected output. In quantum computing, however, it is impossible to directly check the equivalence of the two quantum states. Instead, we rely on statistical testing, which involves repeated program executions, state measurements, and subsequent comparisons with the specified output. To guarantee a high level of assurance, however, this method requires an extensive number of measurements. In this paper, we propose a solution to alleviate this challenge by adapting Fixed-Point Amplitude Amplification (FPAA) for quantum program testing. We formally present our technique, demonstrate its ability to reduce the required number of measurements as well as runtime cost without sacrificing the original statistical guarantee, and showcase its runtime effectiveness through case studies.},

 abstract = {The most promising applications of quantum computing are centered around solving search and optimization tasks, particularly in fields such as physics simulations, quantum chemistry, and finance. However, the current quantum software testing methods face practical limitations when applied in industrial contexts: (i) they do not apply to quantum programs most relevant to the industry, (ii) they require a full program specification, which is usually not available for these programs, and (iii) they are incompatible with error mitigation methods currently adopted by main industry actors like IBM. To address these challenges, we present QOPS, a novel quantum software testing approach. QOPS introduces a new definition of test cases based on Pauli strings to improve compatibility with different quantum programs. QOPS also introduces a new test oracle that can be directly integrated with industrial APIs such as IBM’s Estimator API and can utilize error mitigation methods for testing on real noisy quantum computers. We also leverage the commuting property of Pauli strings to relax the requirement of having complete program specifications, making QOPS practical for testing complex quantum programs in industrial settings. We empirically evaluate QOPS on 194,982 real quantum programs, demonstrating effective performance in test assessment compared to the state-of-the-art with a perfect F1-score, precision, and recall. Furthermore, we validate the industrial applicability of QOPS by assessing its performance on IBM’s three real quantum computers, incorporating both industrial and open-source error mitigation methods.CCS Concepts• Software and its engineering → Correctness, • Theory of computation → Quantum computation theory, • Computer systems organization → Quantum computing},

The quantum application can be verified quickly by checking these assertions in test cases on simulators. Our framework introduces practical mechanisms for quantum application development. It separates the construction procedure of a quantum application and its assertions through parameter distinction, introduces an evaluation rule for early precondition checking, and reduces assertion-writing effort through assertion reuse mechanisms for inverting quantum circuits and using quantum circuits for qubits in a superposition state.

@article{oldfield2025faster,
 abstract = {Quantum computing (QC) promises polynomial and exponential speedups in many domains, such as unstructured search and prime number factoring. However, quantum programs yield probabilistic outputs from exponentially growing distributions and are vulnerable to quantum-specific faults. Existing quantum software testing (QST) approaches treat quantum superpositions as classical distributions. This leads to two major limitations when applied to quantum programs: (1) an exponentially growing sample space distribution and (2) failing to detect quantum-specific faults such as phase flips. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a QST approach, which applies a reduction algorithm to a quantum program specification. The reduced specification alleviates the limitations (1) by enabling faster sampling through quantum parallelism and (2) by performing projective measurements in the mixed Hadamard basis. Our evaluation of 143 quantum programs across four categories demonstrates significant improvements in test runtimes and fault detection with our reduction approach. Average test runtimes improved from 169.9 s to 11.8 s, with notable enhancements in programs with large circuit depths (383.1 s to 33.4 s) and large program specifications (464.8 s to 7.7 s). Furthermore, our approach increases mutation scores from  (54.5%)  to  (74.7%) , effectively detecting phase flip faults that non-reduced specifications miss. These results underline our approach's importance to improve QST efficiency and effectiveness.},

@article{tan2025hornbro,
 abstract = {Quantum programs provide exponential speedups compared to classical programs in certain areas, but they also inevitably encounter logical faults. Automatically repairing quantum programs is much more challenging than repairing classical programs due to the non-replicability of data, the vast search space of program inputs, and the new programming paradigm. Existing works based on semantic-based or learning-based program repair techniques are fundamentally limited in repairing efficiency and effectiveness. In this work, we propose HornBro, an efficient framework for automated quantum program repair. The key insight of HornBro lies in the homotopy-like method, which iteratively switches between the classical and quantum parts. This approach allows the repair tasks to be efficiently offloaded to the most suitable platforms, enabling a progressive convergence toward the correct program. We start by designing an implication assertion pragma to enable rigorous specifications of quantum program behavior, which helps to generate a quantum test suite automatically. This suite leverages the orthonormal bases of quantum programs to accommodate different encoding schemes. Given a fixed number of test cases, it allows the maximum input coverage of potential counter-example candidates. Then, we develop a Clifford approximation method with an SMT-based search to transform the patch localization program into a symbolic reasoning problem. Finally, we offload the computationally intensive repair of gate parameters to quantum hardware by leveraging the differentiability of quantum gates. Experiments suggest that HornBro increases the repair success rate by more than 62.5% compared to the existing repair techniques, supporting more types of quantum bugs. It also achieves 35.7\texttimes{} speedup in the repair and 99.9% gate reduction of the patch.},

@article{li2025preparation,
 abstract = {Due to the growing demand for high-quality quantum programs (QPs), unit testing is employed to check the behavior of QPs. As for quantum inputs of testing, most studies limit test inputs to pure states, whereas mixed states representing probabilistic mixtures of pure states are almost excluded from the test process. Besides, when achieving the input domain coverage, lots of pure-state test cases (PSTCs) with pure states as inputs should be employed, leading to high time costs for testing. To handle that, this article explores using mixed states as test inputs for better utilization of quantum information. From the perspective of input domain coverage, applying mixed-state test cases (MSTCs) replacing PSTCs can simplify the test suite and accordingly promote test efficiency. Owing to the mixture of multiple pure states, a single MSTC is more likely to detect a fault than a PSTC, thereby enhancing test effectiveness. This article then proposes a unit testing framework, including generation and execution of MSTCs. Also, this article presents two guidelines and two parameterized quantum circuits to prepare desired mixed states. Empirical studies evaluate the performance of MSTCs and the experimental results demonstrate that MSCTs generally consume less time and detect more faults than PSTCs.},

To fully exploit QC’s potential, it is crucial to ensure the reliability and quality of quantum programs. Research on quantum program testing is still at its early stage, in which some distinctive features of quantum programs, e.g., superposition and entanglement, may be overlooked, and the fault detection capability and testing effectiveness are rather limited. Besides, the input space of quantum programs may exponentially grow when the number of qubits increases, posing great challenges to testing quantum programs. It is imperative to develop a proper testing strategy to effectively select the potential failure-causing test cases and detect faults faster. In this paper, test cases with both basis states and superposition ones are considered and generated to cover more input space. A hybrid distance measurement method based on quantum fidelity and Hamming distance is presented for measuring the similarity among quantum test cases. Furthermore, a Dynamic Random Testing strategy based on Hybrid distance metrics (DRT-H) for quantum programs is proposed, which combines the hybrid distance metrics and the feedback mechanism of the classical Dynamic Random Testing (DRT) strategy to adjust the testing profile and guide the test case selection. Experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed DRT-H strategy outperforms the baseline testing strategies in most cases.},

 abstract = {Recent advancements in quantum computing software are gradually increasing the scope and size of quantum programs being developed. At the same time, however, these larger programs provide more possibilities for functional errors that are harder to detect and resolve. Meanwhile, debugging tools that could aid developers in resolving these errors are still barely existent and far from what we take for granted in classical design automation and software engineering. As a result, even if one manages to identify the incorrect behavior of a developed quantum program, detecting and resolving the underlying errors in the program remains a time-consuming and tedious task. Moreover, the exponential growth of the state space in quantum programs makes the efficient manual investigation of errors radically difficult even for respectively simple algorithms, and almost impossible as the number of qubits increases. To address this problem, this work proposes a debugging framework, available as an open-source implementation at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-debugger. It assists developers in debugging errors in quantum programs, allowing them to efficiently identify the existence of errors and diagnose their causes. Users are given the ability to place assertions in the code that test for the correctness of a given algorithm and are evaluated using classical simulations of the underlying quantum program. Once an assertion fails, the proposed framework employs different diagnostic methods to point towards possible error causes. This way, the debugging workload for quantum programs is drastically reduced.},

However, similar to classical computing, to fully exploit QC's potential, it is important to ensure the correctness of quantum programs. Doing so via software testing is, however, very challenging because of QC's inherent properties: superposition and entanglement. Towards the direction of ensuring the correctness of quantum programs, we propose an approach called QuCAT (QUantum CombinAtorial Testing) for systematic and automated testing of quantum programs by benefiting from combinatorial testing, which has been proven to be cost-effective in testing classical programs. QuCAT supports two combinatorial test suite generation scenarios, i.e., generating combinatorial test suites of a given strength, and incrementally generating and executing combinatorial test suites of increasing strength until a fault is found. The approach employs two types of test oracles to assess test results. We performed an empirical study with 18 faulty versions of quantum programs to evaluate QuCAT with strengths of two, three, and four in the two test generation scenarios. We compare the cost-effectiveness of combinatorial testing of various strengths and random testing (taken as baseline approach). Results show that combinatorial testing always performs better than random testing with the same cost and finds faults more quickly (in terms of required number of test cases). In addition, in most cases, combinatorial testing with a higher strength outperforms the lower strength in terms of effectiveness.},

Unlike classical computers where the output of a program is usually deterministic, the execution of a quantum program may be affected by quantum noise. Such a difference may cause difficulties or misunderstandings for developers shifting from classical programming to quantum programming. To understand the impact of quantum noise on quantum programs and its implications for software developers, we conduct a series of studies with real-world quantum programs and quantum computing environments. Specifically, we first measure and analyze the noise in a real quantum computer by testing it with a basic quantum program. We find that a non-neglectable amount of quantum noise generally exists in real quantum computers. Then we investigate the robustness of quantum programs against different quantum noises by testing 18 real -world quantum programs and 50,000 randomly generated quantum circuits in simulated and real environments. We observe that quantum noise can significantly influence the correctness of quantum programs, and different quantum circuit structures show diverse sensitivity patterns under the same noise. Based on the observations, we build a machine learning model to predict the fidelity of a quantum program under certain quantum noise. The model achieves a small average fidelity prediction error, meaning the impact of noise can be precisely estimated statistically.},

@article{muqeet2024mitigating,
 abstract = {Quantum Computing (QC) promises computational speedup over classic computing. However, noise exists in near-term quantum computers. Quantum software testing (for gaining confidence in quantum software's correctness) is inevitably impacted by noise, i.e., it is impossible to know if a test case failed due to noise or real faults. Existing testing techniques test quantum programs without considering noise, i.e., by executing tests on ideal quantum computer simulators. Consequently, they are not directly applicable to test quantum software on real quantum computers or noisy simulators. Thus, we propose a noise-aware approach (named $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN) to alleviate the noise effect on test results of quantum programs. $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN employs machine learning techniques (e.g., transfer learning) to learn the noise effect of a quantum computer and filter it from a program's outputs. Such filtered outputs are then used as the input to perform test case assessments (determining the passing or failing of a test case execution against a test oracle). We evaluated $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN on IBM's 23 noise models, Google's two available noise models, and Rigetti's Quantum Virtual Machine, with six real-world and 800 artificial programs. We also generated faulty versions of these programs to check if a failing test case execution can be determined under noise. Results show that $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN can reduce the noise effect by more than $80\%$80% on most noise models. We used an existing test oracle to evaluate $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN's effectiveness in quantum software testing. The results showed that $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN attained scores of $99\%$99%, $75\%$75%, and $86\%$86% for precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively, for the test oracle across six real-world programs. For artificial programs, $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN achieved scores of $93\%$93%, $79\%$79%, and $86\%$86% for precision, recall, and F1-score respectively. This highlights $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN's effectiveness in learning noise patterns for noise-aware quantum software testing.},

@article{fortunato2022mutation,
 abstract = {As quantum computing is still in its infancy, there is an inherent lack of knowledge and technology to test a quantum program properly. In the classical realm, mutation testing has been successfully used to evaluate how well a program's test suite detects seeded faults (i.e., mutants). In this article, building on the definition of syntactically equivalent quantum operations, we propose a novel set of mutation operators to generate mutants based on qubit measurements and quantum gates. To ease the adoption of quantum mutation testing, we further propose QMutPy, an extension of the well-known and fully automated open-source mutation tool MutPy. To evaluate QMutPy's performance, we conducted a case study on 24 real quantum programs written in IBM's Qiskit library. Furthermore, we show how better test suite coverage and improvements to test assertions can increase the test suites' mutation score and quality. QMutPy has proven to be an effective quantum mutation tool, providing insight into the current state of quantum tests and how to improve them.},

@article{usandizaga2025quantum,
 abstract = {As a new research area, quantum software testing lacks systematic testing benchmarks to assess testing techniques' effectiveness. Recently, some open-source benchmarks and mutation analysis tools have emerged. However, there is insufficient evidence on how various quantum circuit characteristics (e.g., circuit depth, number of quantum gates), algorithms (e.g., Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm), and mutation characteristics (e.g., mutation operators) affect the detection of mutants in quantum circuits. Studying such relations is important to systematically design faulty benchmarks with varied attributes (e.g., the difficulty in detecting a seeded fault) to facilitate assessing the cost-effectiveness of quantum software testing techniques efficiently. To this end, we present a large-scale empirical evaluation with more than 700K faulty benchmarks (quantum circuits) generated by mutating 382 real-world quantum circuits. Based on the results, we provide valuable insights for researchers to define systematic quantum mutation analysis techniques. We also provide a tool to recommend mutants to users based on chosen characteristics (e.g., a quantum algorithm type) and the required difficulty of detecting mutants. Finally, we also provide faulty benchmarks that can already be used to assess the cost-effectiveness of quantum software testing techniques.},

@article{park2025squad,
 abstract = {In modern neural network research, quantum neural network (QNN) methodologies have been widely adopted due to their inherent quantum advantages. QNN architectures can be partitioned, with each segment distributed across multiple computing machines to preserve privacy-an approach referred to as quantum split learning. Although several novel QNN software testing techniques have been introduced, no methodology currently exists for testing quantum distributed learning software such as quantum split learning. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new software testing method for quantum distributed/split learning, named SQUAD. The proposed SQUAD automatically generates dummy code to complete QNN architectures across separate machines and subsequently performs software testing on all machines. Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) for SQUAD is implemented to demonstrate its novelty and feasibility.},

@inproceedings{liu2020quantum,
 abstract = {In this paper, we propose quantum circuits for runtime assertions, which can be used for both software debugging and error detection. Runtime assertion is challenging in quantum computing for two key reasons. First, a quantum bit (qubit) cannot be copied, which is known as the non-cloning theorem. Second, when a qubit is measured, its superposition state collapses into a classical state, losing the inherent parallel information. In this paper, we overcome these challenges with runtime computation through ancilla qubits, which are used to indirectly collect the information of the qubits of interest. We design quantum circuits to assert classical states, entanglement, and superposition states. Our experimental results show that they are effective in debugging as well as improving the success rate for various Quantum algorithms and subroutines on IBM Q quantum computers.},
