# Exclusion Criteria (Second)

+ Technical papers (not tutorial, future idea, including early access) 
+ Include empirical studies 
+ Within the scope of software testing in QSE 
  + excluding formal verification and validation
  + excluding papers who primary goal is not quantum software testing (e.g., QST is one of the case studies)
+ Quantum programs/circuits/software as the objects under test
