abstract = {Quantum computing (QC) promises polynomial and exponential speedups in many domains, such as unstructured search and prime number factoring. However, quantum programs yield probabilistic outputs from exponentially growing distributions and are vulnerable to quantum-specific faults. Existing quantum software testing (QST) approaches treat quantum superpositions as classical distributions. This leads to two major limitations when applied to quantum programs: (1) an exponentially growing sample space distribution and (2) failing to detect quantum-specific faults such as phase flips. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a QST approach, which applies a reduction algorithm to a quantum program specification. The reduced specification alleviates the limitations (1) by enabling faster sampling through quantum parallelism and (2) by performing projective measurements in the mixed Hadamard basis. Our evaluation of 143 quantum programs across four categories demonstrates significant improvements in test runtimes and fault detection with our reduction approach. Average test runtimes improved from 169.9 s to 11.8 s, with notable enhancements in programs with large circuit depths (383.1 s to 33.4 s) and large program specifications (464.8 s to 7.7 s). Furthermore, our approach increases mutation scores from  (54.5%)  to  (74.7%) , effectively detecting phase flip faults that non-reduced specifications miss. These results underline our approach's importance to improve QST efficiency and effectiveness.},

abstract = {Due to the growing demand for high-quality quantum programs (QPs), unit testing is employed to check the behavior of QPs. As for quantum inputs of testing, most studies limit test inputs to pure states, whereas mixed states representing probabilistic mixtures of pure states are almost excluded from the test process. Besides, when achieving the input domain coverage, lots of pure-state test cases (PSTCs) with pure states as inputs should be employed, leading to high time costs for testing. To handle that, this article explores using mixed states as test inputs for better utilization of quantum information. From the perspective of input domain coverage, applying mixed-state test cases (MSTCs) replacing PSTCs can simplify the test suite and accordingly promote test efficiency. Owing to the mixture of multiple pure states, a single MSTC is more likely to detect a fault than a PSTC, thereby enhancing test effectiveness. This article then proposes a unit testing framework, including generation and execution of MSTCs. Also, this article presents two guidelines and two parameterized quantum circuits to prepare desired mixed states. Empirical studies evaluate the performance of MSTCs and the experimental results demonstrate that MSCTs generally consume less time and detect more faults than PSTCs.},

abstract = {A key hurdle to the success of quantum computers is the ability to initialize qubits into a pure state, which can be achieved by cooling qubits down to very low temperatures. Computational cooling of qubits, whereby a subset of the qubits is cooled at the expense of heating the other qubits via the application of special sets of logic gates, offers a route to effectively cool qubits. Here, we present QuL, a programming library which can be used to generate, analyze, and test quantum circuits for various computational cooling protocols. In its most basic usage, QuL enables a novice user to easily produce cooling circuits with minimal input or knowledge required. The programming library, however, offers flexibility to more advanced users to finely tune the cooling protocol used to generate the quantum circuit. Finally, QuL offers methods to assess and compare various cooling protocols for users interested in studying optimal implementation of computational cooling in general, or on specific quantum backends. It is our hope that QuL will not only facilitate the execution of computational cooling on current quantum computers, but also serve as a tool to investigate open questions in the optimal implementation of computational cooling.},

Recently, quantum computing has re-emerged as a promising technology to solve problems that a classical computer could take hundreds of years to solve. However, there are challenges and opportunities for academics and practitioners regarding software engineering practices for testing and debugging quantum programs. This article presents a roadmap for addressing these challenges, pointing out the existing gaps in the literature and suggesting research directions. We discuss the limitations caused by noise, the no-cloning theorem, the lack of a standard architecture for quantum computers, among others. Regarding testing, we highlight gaps and opportunities related to transpilation, mutation analysis, input states with hybrid interfaces, program analysis, and coverage. For debugging, we present the current strategies, including classical techniques applied to quantum programs, quantum-specific assertions, and quantum-related bug patterns. We introduce a conceptual model to illustrate concepts regarding the testing and debugging of quantum programs and the relationship between them. Those concepts are used to identify and discuss research challenges to cope with quantum programs through 2030, focusing on the interfaces between classical and quantum computing and on creating testing and debugging techniques that take advantage of the unique quantum computing characteristics.},

Given a quantum circuit with an input/output specification, our goal is to check whether executing the program on the input state produces the expected output. In quantum computing, however, it is impossible to directly check the equivalence of the two quantum states. Instead, we rely on statistical testing, which involves repeated program executions, state measurements, and subsequent comparisons with the specified output. To guarantee a high level of assurance, however, this method requires an extensive number of measurements. In this paper, we propose a solution to alleviate this challenge by adapting Fixed-Point Amplitude Amplification (FPAA) for quantum program testing. We formally present our technique, demonstrate its ability to reduce the required number of measurements as well as runtime cost without sacrificing the original statistical guarantee, and showcase its runtime effectiveness through case studies.},

abstract = {Quantum Neural Network (QNN) combines the deep learning (DL) principle with the fundamental theory of quantum mechanics to achieve machine learning tasks with quantum acceleration. Recently, QNN systems have been found to manifest robustness issues similar to classical DL systems. There is an urgent need for ways to test their correctness and security. However, QNN systems differ significantly from traditional quantum software and classical DL systems, posing critical challenges for QNN testing. These challenges include the inapplicability of traditional quantum software testing methods to QNN systems due to differences in programming paradigms and decision logic representations, the dependence of quantum test sample generation on perturbation operators, and the absence of effective information in quantum neurons. In this article, we propose QuanTest, a quantum entanglement-guided adversarial testing framework to uncover potential erroneous behaviors in QNN systems. We design a quantum entanglement adequacy criterion to quantify the entanglement acquired by the input quantum states from the QNN system, along with two similarity metrics to measure the proximity of generated quantum adversarial examples to the original inputs. Subsequently, QuanTest formulates the problem of generating test inputs that maximize the quantum entanglement adequacy and capture incorrect behaviors of the QNN system as a joint optimization problem and solves it in a gradient-based manner to generate quantum adversarial examples. Experimental results demonstrate that QuanTest possesses the capability to capture erroneous behaviors in QNN systems (generating 67.48–96.05% more high-quality test samples than the random noise under the same perturbation size constraints). The entanglement-guided approach proves effective in adversarial testing, generating more adversarial examples (maximum increase reached 21.32%).},

abstract = {Numerous quantum algorithms require the use of quantum error correction to overcome the intrinsic unreliability of physical qubits. However, quantum error correction imposes a unique performance bottleneck, known as T-complexity, that can make an implementation of an algorithm as a quantum program run more slowly than on idealized hardware. In this work, we identify that programming abstractions for control flow, such as the quantum if-statement, can introduce polynomial increases in the T-complexity of a program. If not mitigated, this slowdown can diminish the computational advantage of a quantum algorithm.To enable reasoning about the costs of control flow, we present a cost model that a developer can use to accurately analyze the T-complexity of a program under quantum error correction and pinpoint the sources of slowdown. To enable the mitigation of these costs, we present a set of program-level optimizations that a developer can use to rewrite a program to reduce its T-complexity, predict the T-complexity of the optimized program using the cost model, and then compile it to an efficient circuit via a straightforward strategy.We implement the program-level optimizations in Spire, an extension of the Tower quantum compiler. Using a set of 11 benchmark programs that use control flow, we empirically show that the cost model is accurate, and that Spire's optimizations recover programs that are asymptotically efficient, meaning their runtime T-complexity under error correction is equal to their time complexity on idealized hardware.Our results show that optimizing a program before it is compiled to a circuit can yield better results than compiling the program to an inefficient circuit and then invoking a quantum circuit optimizer found in prior work. For our benchmarks, only 2 of 8 tested quantum circuit optimizers recover circuits with asymptotically efficient T-complexity. Compared to these 2 optimizers, Spire uses 54\texttimes{}−2400\texttimes{} less compile time.},

However, the current quantum software testing methods face practical limitations when applied in industrial contexts: (i) they do not apply to quantum programs most relevant to the industry, (ii) they require a full program specification, which is usually not available for these programs, and (iii) they are incompatible with error mitigation methods currently adopted by main industry actors like IBM. To address these challenges, we present QOPS, a novel quantum software testing approach. QOPS introduces a new definition of test cases based on Pauli strings to improve compatibility with different quantum programs. QOPS also introduces a new test oracle that can be directly integrated with industrial APIs such as IBM's Estimator API and can utilize error mitigation methods for testing on real noisy quantum computers. We also leverage the commuting property of Pauli strings to relax the requirement of having complete program specifications, making QOPS practical for testing complex quantum programs in industrial settings. We empirically evaluate QOPS on 194,982 real quantum programs, demonstrating effective performance in test assessment compared to the state-of-the-art with a perfect F1-score, precision, and recall. Furthermore, we validate the industrial applicability of QOPS by assessing its performance on IBM's three real quantum computers, incorporating both industrial and open-source error mitigation methods.},

The quantum application can be verified quickly by checking these assertions in test cases on simulators. Our framework introduces practical mechanisms for quantum application development. It separates the construction procedure of a quantum application and its assertions through parameter distinction, introduces an evaluation rule for early precondition checking, and reduces assertion-writing effort through assertion reuse mechanisms for inverting quantum circuits and using quantum circuits for qubits in a superposition state.

abstract = {Classical simulation of quantum circuits is critical for the development of implementations of quantum   algorithms: it does not require access to specialized hardware, facilitates debugging by allowing direct access   to the quantum state, and is the only way to test on inputs that are too big for current NISQ computers.    Many quantum algorithms rely on invariants that result in sparsity in the state vector. A sparse state vector   simulator only computes with non-zero amplitudes. For important classes of algorithms, this results in an   asymptotic improvement in simulation time. While promising prior work has investigated ways to exploit   sparsity, it is still unclear what is the best way to scale sparse simulation to modern multi-core architectures.    In this work, we address this challenge and present qblaze, a highly optimized sparse state vector simulator   based on (i) a compact sorted array representation, and (ii) new, easily parallelizable and highly-scalable   algorithms for all quantum operations. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that qblaze is often   orders-of-magnitude more efficient than prior sparse state vector simulators even on a single thread, and also   that qblaze scales well to a large number of CPU cores.    Overall, our work enables testing quantum algorithms on input sizes that were previously out of reach.},

abstract = {Quantum programs provide exponential speedups compared to classical programs in certain areas, but they also inevitably encounter logical faults. Automatically repairing quantum programs is much more challenging than repairing classical programs due to the non-replicability of data, the vast search space of program inputs, and the new programming paradigm. Existing works based on semantic-based or learning-based program repair techniques are fundamentally limited in repairing efficiency and effectiveness. In this work, we propose HornBro, an efficient framework for automated quantum program repair. The key insight of HornBro lies in the homotopy-like method, which iteratively switches between the classical and quantum parts. This approach allows the repair tasks to be efficiently offloaded to the most suitable platforms, enabling a progressive convergence toward the correct program. We start by designing an implication assertion pragma to enable rigorous specifications of quantum program behavior, which helps to generate a quantum test suite automatically. This suite leverages the orthonormal bases of quantum programs to accommodate different encoding schemes. Given a fixed number of test cases, it allows the maximum input coverage of potential counter-example candidates. Then, we develop a Clifford approximation method with an SMT-based search to transform the patch localization program into a symbolic reasoning problem. Finally, we offload the computationally intensive repair of gate parameters to quantum hardware by leveraging the differentiability of quantum gates. Experiments suggest that HornBro increases the repair success rate by more than 62.5% compared to the existing repair techniques, supporting more types of quantum bugs. It also achieves 35.7\texttimes{} speedup in the repair and 99.9% gate reduction of the patch.},

abstract = {Stabilizer states are fundamental families of quantum states with crucial applications such as error correction, quantum computation, and simulation of quantum circuits. In this paper, we study the problem of testing how close or far a quantum state is to a stabilizer state. We make two contributions: First, we improve the state-of-the-art parameters for the tolerant testing of stabilizer states. In particular, we show that there is an efficient quantum primitive to distinguish if the maximum fidelity of a quantum state with a stabilizer state is ≥ є1 or ≤ є2, given one of them is the case, provided that є2 ≤ є1O(1). This result improves the parameters in the previous work which assumed є2 ≤ e− 1/є1O(1). Our proof technique extends the toolsets developed in before by applying a random Clifford map which balances the characteristic function of a quantum state, enabling the use of standard proof techniques from higher-order Fourier analysis for Boolean functions, where improved testing bounds are available. Second, we study the problem of testing low stabilizer rank states. We show that if for an infinite family of quantum states stabilizer rank is lower than a constant independent of system size, then stabilizer fidelity is lower bounded by an absolute constant. Using a result on estimating stabilizer fidelity of quantum states, one of the implications of this result is that low approximate stabilizer rank states are not pseudo-random.},

abstract = {Quantum computing platforms rely on simulators for modelling circuit behaviour prior to hardware execution, where inconsistencies can lead to costly errors. While existing formal validation methods typically target specific compiler components to manage state explosion, they often miss critical bugs. Meanwhile, conventional testing lacks systematic exploration of corner cases and realistic execution scenarios, resulting in both false positives and negatives.    We present FuzzQ, a novel framework that bridges this gap by combining formal methods with structured test generation and fuzzing for quantum simulators.   Our approach employs differential benchmarking complemented by mutation testing and invariant checking. At its core, FuzzQ utilises our Alloy-based formal model of QASM 3.0, which encodes the semantics of quantum circuits to enable automated analysis and to generate structurally diverse, constraint-guided quantum circuits with guaranteed properties.   We introduce several test oracles to assess both Alloy’s modelling of QASM 3.0 and simulator correctness, including invariant-based checks, statistical distribution tests, and a novel cross-simulator unitary consistency check that verifies functional equivalence modulo global phase, revealing discrepancies that standard statevector comparisons fail to detect in cross-platform differential testing.    We evaluate FuzzQ on both Qiskit and Cirq, demonstrating its platform-agnostic effectiveness. By executing over 800,000 quantum circuits to completion, we assess throughput, code and circuit coverage, and simulator performance metrics, including sensitivity, correctness, and memory overhead. Our analysis revealed eight simulator bugs, six previously undocumented. We also outline a path for extending the framework to support mixed-state simulations under realistic noise models.},

abstract = {Quantum circuit simulation (QCS) plays an important role in the designs and analysis of a quantum algorithm, as it assists researchers in understanding how quantum operations work without accessing expensive quantum computers. Despite many QCS methods, they are largely limited to simulating one input at a time. However, many simulation-driven quantum computing applications, such as testing and verification, require simulating multiple inputs to reason a quantum algorithm under different scenarios. We refer to this type of QCS as batch quantum circuit simulation (BQCS). In this paper, we present BQSim, a GPU-accelerated batch quantum circuit simulator. BQSim is inspired by the state-of-the-art decision diagram (DD) that can compactly represent quantum gate matrices, but overcomes its limitation of CPU-centric simulation. Specifically, BQSim uses DD to optimize a quantum circuit for reduced BQCS computation and converts DD to a GPU-efficient data structure. Additionally, BQSim employs a task graph-based execution strategy to minimize repetitive kernel call overhead and efficiently overlap kernel execution with data movement. Compared with three state-of-the-art quantum circuit simulators, cuQuantum, Qiskit Aer, and FlatDD, BQSim is 3.25\texttimes{}, 159.06\texttimes{}, and 311.42\texttimes{} faster on average.},

This article addresses the specific testing requirements of multi-subroutine quantum programs. We begin by investigating critical properties by surveying existing quantum libraries and providing insights into the challenges of testing these programs. Building upon this understanding, we focus on testing criteria and techniques based on the whole testing process perspective, spanning from unit testing to integration testing. We delve into various aspects, including IO analysis, quantum relation checking, structural testing, behavior testing, integration of subroutine pairs, and test case generation. We also introduce novel testing principles and criteria to guide the testing process. We conduct comprehensive testing on typical quantum subroutines, including diverse mutants and randomized inputs, to evaluate our proposed approach. The analysis of failures provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of our testing methodology. Additionally, we present case studies on representative multi-subroutine quantum programs, demonstrating the practical application and effectiveness of our proposed testing principles and criteria.},

abstract = {Fueled by recent accomplishments in quantum computing hardware and software, an increasing number of problems from various application domains are being explored as potential use cases for this new technology. Similarly to classical computing, realizing an application on a particular quantum device requires the corresponding (quantum) circuit to be compiled so that it can be executed on the device. With a steadily growing number of available devices—each with their own advantages and disadvantages—and a wide variety of different compilation tools, the number of choices to consider when trying to realize an application is quickly exploding. Due to missing tool support and automation, especially end-users who are not quantum computing experts are easily left unsupported and overwhelmed.In this work, we propose a methodology that allows one to automatically select a suitable quantum device for a particular application and provides an optimized compiler for the selected device. The resulting framework—called the MQT&nbsp;Predictor—not only supports end-users in navigating the vast landscape of choices, it also allows mixing and matching compiler passes from various tools to create optimized compilers that transcend the individual tools. Evaluations of an exemplary framework instantiation based on more than 500 quantum circuits and seven devices have shown that—compared with both Qiskit’s and TKET’s most optimized compilation flows for all devices—the MQT&nbsp;Predictor produces circuits within the top-3 out of 14 baselines in more than 98% of cases while frequently outperforming any tested combination by up to 53% when optimizing for expected fidelity. Additionally, the framework is trained and evaluated for critical depth as another figure of merit to showcase its flexibility and generalizability—producing circuits within the top-3 in 89% of cases while frequently outperforming any tested combination by up to 400%. MQT&nbsp;Predictor is part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit&nbsp;(MQT) and publicly available as open-source on GitHub () and as an easy-to-use Python package ().},

Reducing the space-time cost of circuit execution can significantly improve the throughput of modern quantum cloud platforms. While utilizing more physical qubits can reduce execution time, different quantum circuits vary in their ability to leverage chip resources. Therefore, optimizing the compilation of surface code circuits on quantum chips becomes critical. In this work, we address the mapping and scheduling problem in compiling surface code to reduce the cost. First, we introduce a novel metric Circuit Parallelism Degree  to characterize circuit properties in detail and select the most suitable chip from a list of available options. Next, we will quantitatively assess the resources to determine if they are sufficient for the circuit. We then propose a resource-adaptive mapping and scheduling method called Ecmas+, which customizes the initialization of chip resources for each circuit. Ecmas+ significantly reduces execution time in the double defect and lattice surgery models. Extensive numerical tests on practical datasets demonstrate that Ecmas+ outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing execution time by an average of 46% for the double defect model and 29.7% for the lattice surgery model.},

abstract = {With the growing interest in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and the increasing availability of quantum computers through cloud providers, addressing the potential security risks associated with QML has become an urgent priority. One key concern in the QML domain is the threat of data poisoning attacks in the current quantum cloud setting. Adversarial access to training data could severely compromise the integrity and availability of QML models. Classical data poisoning techniques require significant knowledge and training to generate poisoned data, and lack noise resilience, making them ineffective for QML models in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. In this work, we first propose a simple yet effective technique to measure intra-class encoder state similarity (ESS) by analyzing the outputs of encoding circuits. Leveraging this approach, we introduce a Quantum Indiscriminate Data Poisoning attack, QUID. Through extensive experiments conducted in both noiseless and noisy environments (e.g., IBM_Brisbane’s noise), across various architectures and datasets, QUID achieves up to ( 92% ) accuracy degradation in model performance compared to baseline models and up to ( 75% ) accuracy degradation compared to random label-flipping. We also tested QUID against state-of-the-art classical defenses, with accuracy degradation still exceeding ( 50% ), demonstrating its effectiveness. This work represents the first attempt to reevaluate data poisoning attacks in the context of QML.},

Quantum Computers (QCs) can effectively find optimal or near-optimal solutions by exploring the solutions space of a problem encoded in a qubits system, exploiting principles of quantum mechanics. However, non-idealities and high costs limit their availability. These can be overcome by emulating QCs on cheaper and more accessible classical computing platforms, like Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).This article presents a digital architecture, implementing the Ising-compatible Simulated Adiabatic Bifurcation algorithm. It mimics the quantum adiabatic evolution of a network of non-linear Kerr oscillators. The architecture, described in VHDL and targeting FPGAs, consists of processing elements for computing the Kerr oscillators’ evolution, a set of units considering their Ising-related interactions and an evolution variables update unit. The proposed approach includes a speedup-targeting approximation of the algorithm, a method for handling single-variable constraints, and a software model that allows architecture customization for specific problems. Tests were conducted using an Altera Cyclone V SoC with FPGA logic and the Nios II processor for interface purposes. The results demonstrate the functionality of the architecture and its scalability with the problem size, making it suitable for real-world applications.},

The accuracy of these models relies on the amount of training data, due to the multitude of parameters that require tuning. Unfortunately, obtaining such ample data proves challenging, particularly in domains like medical applications, where there is a pressing need for robust models for early disease detection but a shortage of labeled data. Nevertheless, the classical supervised contrastive learning models, have shown the potential to address this challenge up to a certain limit, by utilizing deep encoder models. However, recent advancements in quantum machine learning enable the extraction of meaningful representations from extremely limited and simple data. Thus, replacing classical counterparts in classical or hybrid quantum-classical supervised contrastive models enhances feature learning capability with minimal data. Therefore, this work proposes the Q-SupCon model, a fully quantum-powered supervised contrastive learning model comprising a quantum data augmentation circuit, quantum encoder, quantum projection head, and quantum variational classifier, enabling efficient image classification with minimal labeled data. Furthermore, the novel model attains 80%, 60%, and 80% test accuracy on MNIST, KMNIST, and FMNIST datasets, marking a significant advancement in addressing the data scarcity challenge.},

The area of testing in quantum systems has received greater attention in research on this topic to guarantee the quality and reliability of these technologies. Objective: This paper presents an empirical study focused on the testing of quantum software at its classical layer. Specifically, it aims to identify and analyze the unique characteristics of quantum software tests, particularly in terms of Test Smells, their distribution, recurrence, and differences compared to classical software tests. Method: We used two sets of software from previous studies, one comprising 12 quantum software and the other comprising 80 classical software. From these datasets, we conducted an analysis to detect 10 test smells, allowing us to map their dispersion in quantum software, identify their specific characteristics, and draw comparisons with classical software. Results: Our findings reveal a high dispersion of test smells of 51% in quantum software. Furthermore, quantum tests exhibit statistical differences from classical software tests, with the most outlier being Conditional Test Logic, which is 20% more frequent than in classical software. Conclusions: The insights gained from this study can contribute to enhancing the quality, maintainability, and readability of tests written for the classical layer of quantum software. Ultimately, this can improve the overall understanding and quality of quantum software.},

abstract = {In recent years, malicious software has risen in both number and effectiveness of attacks, particularly due to the increased utilization of machine learning and even quantum computing by cybercriminals. This research addresses the disparity between these rapidly progressing technologies and the lack of advanced cybersecurity systems in nearly half of all American small businesses by creating accessible malware detection software on Google Colaboratory, a cloud-based software hosting service. Neural networks (NN), a common machine learning model for cybersecurity tasks, were created with both classical and simulated quantum computing using Python libraries, starter code, and an Android malware dataset. The average F1 score of accuracy of the classical NN, 0.6928, was slightly higher than the average F1 score of the quantum NN, 0.6406. However, a two-sample t-test found that the true means of both populations of F1 scores were statistically equal, indicating no difference in accuracy between classical and simulated quantum neural networks at this time. Differences in resource efficiency could not accurately be assessed, because although the quantum neural network was simulated on a classical computer and had a much higher runtime, a quantum neural network running on a quantum computer can be significantly faster than a classical neural network running on a classical computer for certain types of problems; this is because of unique quantum properties like superposition and entanglement that allow complex calculations to be performed much more efficiently. This research does find, however, that features related to the services or transactions of Android applications had higher correlations with malicious/benign software status, the change in runtime of a classical NN on Google Colaboratory was roughly linear over a large range of sample sizes, and two iterations of text segments and comments within the software improved the usability of the tool. Overall, the study develops a methodology for creating and evaluating open-source quantum and classical machine learning cybersecurity software for small businesses.},

abstract = {Quantum circuit testing is essential for detecting potential faults in realistic quantum devices, while the testing process itself also suffers from the inexactness and unreliability of quantum operations. This article alleviates the issue by proposing a novel framework of automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) for robust testing of logical quantum circuits. We introduce the stabilizer projector decomposition (SPD) for representing the quantum test pattern and construct the test application (i.e., state preparation and measurement) using Clifford-only circuits, which are rather robust and efficient as evidenced in the fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, it is generally hard to generate SPDs due to the exponentially growing number of the stabilizer projectors. To circumvent this difficulty, we develop an SPD generation algorithm, as well as several acceleration techniques that can exploit both locality and sparsity in generating SPDs. The effectiveness of our algorithms are validated by (1) theoretical guarantees under reasonable conditions and (2) experimental results on commonly used benchmark circuits, such as Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), Quantum Volume (QV), and Bernstein-Vazirani (BV) in IBM Qiskit.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, several quantum software stacks (QSS) have been developed in response to rapid hardware advances in quantum computing. A QSS includes a quantum programming language, an optimizing compiler that translates a quantum algorithm written in a high-level language into quantum gate instructions, a quantum simulator that emulates these instructions on a classical device, and a software controller that sends analog signals to a very expensive quantum hardware based on quantum circuits. In comparison to traditional compilers and architecture simulators, QSSes are difficult to tests due to the probabilistic nature of results, the lack of clear hardware specifications, and quantum programming complexity.This work devises a novel differential testing approach for QSSes, named QDIFF with three major innovations: (1) We generate input programs to be tested via semantics-preserving, source to source transformation to explore program variants. (2) We speed up differential testing by filtering out quantum circuits that are not worthwhile to execute on quantum hardware by analyzing static characteristics such as a circuit depth, 2-gate operations, gate error rates, and T1 relaxation time. (3) We design an extensible equivalence checking mechanism via distribution comparison functions such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and cross entropy.We evaluate QDiff with three widely-used open source QSSes: Qiskit from IBM, Cirq from Google, and Pyquil from Rigetti. By running QDiff on both real hardware and quantum simulators, we found several critical bugs revealing potential instabilities in these platforms. QDiff's source transformation is effective in producing semantically equivalent yet not-identical circuits (i.e., 34% of trials), and its filtering mechanism can speed up differential testing by 66%.},

Inspired by applications of QNN across fields, we investigate their use in software testing for the Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN), part of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH), responsible for cancer statistics among the Norwegian population. CRN develops a complex socio-technical software system, Cancer Registration Support System ( (mathtt{CaReSS}) ), interacting with many entities (e.g., hospitals, medical laboratories, and other patient registries) to achieve its task. For cost-effective testing of  (mathtt{CaReSS}) , CRN has employed  (mathtt{EvoMaster}) , an AI-based REST API testing tool combined with an integrated classical machine learning model  (mathtt{EvoClass}) . Within this context, we propose  (mathtt{EvoQlass})  to investigate the feasibility of using, inside  (mathtt{EvoMaster}) , a QNN classifier, instead of the existing classical machine learning model. Results indicate that  (mathtt{EvoQlass})  can achieve performance comparable to that of  (mathtt{EvoClass}) . We further explore the effects of various QNN configurations on performance and offer recommendations for optimal QNN settings for future QNN developers.},

With the first functionality, the tool generates a test suite of a given strength (e.g., pair-wise). With the second functionality, it generates test suites with increasing strength until a failure is triggered or a maximum strength is reached. QuCAT uses two test oracles to check the correctness of test outputs. We assess the cost and effectiveness of QuCAT with 3 faulty versions of 5 quantum programs. Results show that combinatorial test suites with a low strength can find faults with limited cost, while a higher strength performs better to trigger some difficult faults with relatively higher cost.

abstract = {The quantum computing (QC) field is rapidly moving beyond the realm of pure science to become a commercially viable technology that may be able to overcome the drawbacks of traditional computing. Major technology tycoons have spent in building coding frameworks and hardware to create applications specifically designed for quantum computing over the last few years. The development of QC hardware is accelerating, however, the requirement for software-intensive methodology, approaches, procedures, instruments, roles and responsibilities for creating industrial-focused quantum software applications arises from operationalizing the QC. This paper outlines the concept of quantum software engineering (QSE) life cycle, which entails the engineering of quantum requirements, design, implementation, testing and maintenance of quantum software. This paper notably advocates for collaborative efforts between the industrial community and software engineering research to propose practical solutions to support the complete activities for the development of quantum software. The proposed vision makes it easier for researchers and practitioners to suggest new procedures, reference designs, cutting-edge equipment, and methods for utilizing quantum computers and creating the newest and most advanced quantum software.},

abstract = {Quantum computing will make it possible to exponentially accelerate the performance of a wide range of computational problems, such as cryptography, machine learning or chemical simulation. However, the quantum potential is not only a matter of hardware, but also of software. Therefore, this new paradigm has an impact yet to be explored on software development processes and techniques, and the adaptation of classical software engineering to the new classical/quantum hybrid systems raises a number of important challenges: a new Quantum Software Engineering is therefore needed. Specifically, and focusing on quantum software quality, software verification remains an open research question, as its novelty and complexity make quantum software development a particularly error-prone process. Most current approaches to test-driven verification rely heavily on simulations, which is a problem due to the lack of scalability of simulators running on classical computers. To address this shortcoming, we define the concept of a "Quantum Test Case", and then present a method to test quantum circuits on real machines, without using simulation test functionalities such as amplitude calculation or non-destructive measurement. This is achieved by automatically generating a Quantum Test Case, which wraps the circuit under test and performs the verification. We also present the process to run a set of tests on a circuit with this method, along with an example to illustrate the technique.},

This work aims to replicate the excellent results of hybrid quantum approaches for syntactic tasks on semantic classification tasks. In detail, a quantum machine learning algorithm, namely, the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), is used to perform sentiment analysis classification tasks. This algorithm can deduce the relationships between input features and their corresponding class affiliations using a parametrized quantum circuit and an encoding layer that translates classical data into quantum states.

abstract = {Quantum annealers are specialized quantum computers for solving combinatorial optimization problems with special quantum computing characteristics, e.g., superposition and entanglement. Theoretically, quantum annealers can outperform classic computers. However, current quantum annealers are constrained by a limited number of qubits and cannot demonstrate quantum advantages. Nonetheless, research is needed to develop novel mechanisms to formulate combinatorial optimization problems for quantum annealing (QA). However, QA applications in software engineering remain unexplored. Thus, we propose BootQA, the very first effort at solving test case minimization (TCM) problems on classical software with QA. We provide a novel TCM formulation for QA and utilize bootstrap sampling to optimize the qubit usage. We also implemented our TCM formulation in three other optimization processes: simulated annealing (SA), QA without problem decomposition, and QA with an existing D-Wave problem decomposition strategy, and conducted an empirical evaluation with three real-world TCM datasets. Results show that BootQA outperforms QA without problem decomposition and QA with the existing decomposition strategy regarding effectiveness. Moreover, BootQA’s effectiveness is similar to SA. Finally, BootQA has higher efficiency in terms of time when solving large TCM problems than the other three optimization processes.},

Unfortunately, testing these platforms is challenging due to the relatively small number of existing quantum programs and because of the oracle problem, i.e., a lack of specifications of the expected behavior of programs. This paper presents MorphQ, the first metamorphic testing approach for quantum computing platforms. Our two key contributions are (i) a program generator that creates a large and diverse set of valid (i.e., non-crashing) quantum programs, and (ii) a set of program transformations that exploit quantum-specific metamorphic relationships to alleviate the oracle problem. Evaluating the approach by testing the popular Qiskit platform shows that the approach creates over 8k program pairs within two days, many of which expose crashes. Inspecting the crashes, we find 13 bugs, nine of which have already been confirmed. MorphQ widens the slim portfolio of testing techniques of quantum computing platforms, helping to create a reliable software stack for this increasingly important field.},

These models are supported by a set of foundation libraries for code development. However, errors can occur in the library implementation, and one common root cause is the lack of or incomplete checks on properties like values, length, and quantum states of inputs passed to user-facing subroutines. This paper presents Upbeat, a fuzzing tool to generate random test cases for bugs related to input checking in Q# libraries. Upbeat develops an automated process to extract constraints from the API documentation and the developer implemented input-checking statements. It leverages open-source Q# code samples to synthesize test programs. It frames the test case generation as a constraint satisfaction problem for classical computing and a quantum state model for quantum computing to produce carefully generated subroutine inputs to test if the input-checking mechanism is appropriately implemented. Under 100 hours of automated test runs, Upbeat has successfully identified 16 bugs in API implementations and 4 documentation errors. Of these, 14 have been confirmed, and 12 have been fixed by the library developers.},

However, to prepare a quantum state that is input to a segment, it is necessary to execute all the segments ahead of that segment in a quantum computer. This means that the cost of testing each segment depends on its location. We can also locate a buggy segment only if it is confirmed that there are no bugs in all segments ahead of that buggy segment. Since a quantum program is tested statistically on the basis of measurement results, there is a tradeoff between testing accuracy and cost. Although these characteristics are unique to quantum programs and complicate locating bugs, they have not been investigated. We suggest for the first time that these characteristics should be considered to efficiently locate bugs. We are also the first to propose a bug-locating method that takes these characteristics into account. The results from experiments indicate that the bug-locating cost, represented as the number of executed quantum gates, can be reduced with the proposed method compared with naive methods.},

abstract = {We study a generalization of entanglement testing which we call the “hidden cut problem.” Taking as input copies of an n-qubit pure state which is product across an unknown bipartition, the goal is to learn precisely where the state is unentangled, i.e. to determine which of the exponentially many possible cuts separates the state. We give a polynomial-time quantum algorithm which can find the cut using O(n/є2) many copies of the state, which is optimal up to logarithmic factors. Our algorithm also generalizes to learn the entanglement structure of arbitrary product states. In the special case of Haar-random states, we further show that our algorithm requires circuits of only constant depth. To develop our algorithm, we introduce a state generalization of the hidden subgroup problem (StateHSP) which might be of independent interest, in which one is given a quantum state invariant under an unknown subgroup action, with the goal of learning the hidden symmetry subgroup. We show how the hidden cut problem can be formulated as a StateHSP with a carefully chosen Abelian group action. We then prove that Fourier sampling on the hidden cut state produces similar outcomes as a variant of the well-known Simon’s problem, allowing us to find the hidden cut efficiently. Therefore, our algorithm can be interpreted as an extension of Simon’s algorithm to entanglement testing. We discuss possible applications of StateHSP and hidden cut problems to cryptography and pseudorandomness.},

High noise levels in a quantum device can lead to errors even when the quantum circuit is not buggy. Therefore, it is essential to verify that the noise level of the device is tolerable while running the quantum circuit. In this paper, we propose a quantum device testing framework using concurrent assertions. Specifically, we introduce a new type of assertion "QcAssert", which has the ability to run concurrently with the quantum circuit to ensure that the quantum device is working as expected. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the QcAssert in dynamic device testing using a suite of popular quantum benchmarks, including Shor's factoring algorithm and Grover's search algorithm.},

abstract = {Quantum computing has gained significant prominence within computer science curricula. Unfortunately, the conventional mechanism for grading programming assignments (running students' code on multiple test cases and verifying the output) is impractical for quantum computing. Scalable quantum computers are unlikely to be available for at least the next several years, and all known methods of simulating their behavior require exponential time.In this work, we present an efficient autograding methodology for quantum programs predicated on two observations: 1) there already exist efficient average-case methods for comparing two implementations of a quantum function for equivalency, and 2) most student submissions for an assignment are functionally identical to at least one previous submission. Our autograder maintains a database of previous submissions and iteratively compares incoming ones against this database. If no matches are found, a series of expensive simulations are performed to assign a score, and the submission along with its grade is added to the database. In the more common case of a hit, the matching score is automatically applied without the need for simulation.In a case study involving an undergraduate quantum computing course, our approach reduced total execution time needed to grade student submissions by 90% when compared to traditional autograding methods while maintaining the same granularity of feedback. We also show that our system demonstrates the largest speedups when under maximum stress, acting as a load balancer and reducing the percentage that hardware must be overprovisioned to handle the maximum load by 20%, yielding a total reduction of 92%.},

This model is a symbiosis of a classical Convolutional NN that performs ultra-sound image processing and a quantum circuit that generates its stochastic weights, within a Bayesian learning framework. To test the utility of this idea for the possible future deployment in the medical sector we track multiple behavioral metrics that capture both predictive performance as well as model’s uncertainty. It is our ambition to create a hybrid model that is capable to classify samples in a more uncertainty aware fashion, which will advance the trustworthiness of these models and thus bring us step closer to utilizing them in the industry. We test multiple setups for quantum circuit for this task, and our best architectures display bigger uncertainty gap between correctly and incorrectly identified samples than its classical benchmark at an expense of a slight drop in predictive performance. The innovation of this paper is two-fold: (1) combining of different approaches that allow the stochastic weights from the quantum circuit to be continues thus allowing the model to classify application-driven dataset; (2) studying architectural features of quantum circuit that make-or-break these models, which pave the way into further investigation of more informed architectural designs.},

To evaluate our technique, we inject faults and semantic preserving changes into three quantum algorithms. We discuss the viability and efficacy of our approach after measuring the percentage of faults and semantic preserving changes. Our results indicate that our method has a high true positive (called sensitivity) and true negative rate (called specificity) and is robust in terms of the amount of changes introduced to the program. Moreover, the sensitivity of the method increases significantly with the number of properties. While the specificity remains stable when increasing the number of properties and inputs.},

abstract = {Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) can potentially solve practical problems using contemporary Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. VQAs find near-optimal solutions in the presence of qubit errors by classically optimizing a loss function computed by parameterized quantum circuits. However, developing and testing VQAs is challenging due to the limited availability of quantum hardware, their high error rates, and the significant overhead of classical simulations. Furthermore, VQA researchers must pick the right initialization for circuit parameters, utilize suitable classical optimizer configurations, and deploy appropriate error mitigation methods. Unfortunately, these tasks are done in an ad-hoc manner today, as there are no software tools to configure and tune the VQA hyperparameters.In this paper, we present OSCAR (cOmpressed Sensing based Cost lAndscape Reconstruction) to help configure: 1) correct initialization, 2) noise mitigation techniques, and 3) classical optimizers to maximize the quality of the solution on NISQ hardware. OSCAR enables efficient debugging and performance tuning by providing users with the loss function landscape without running thousands of quantum circuits as required by the grid search. Using OSCAR, we can accurately reconstruct the complete cost landscape with up to 100X speedup. Furthermore, OSCAR can compute an optimizer function query in an instant by interpolating a computed landscape, thus enabling the trial run of a VQA configuration with considerably reduced overhead.},

This bound is asymptotically tight if linear-time quantum-secure pseudorandom functions exist. Given an n-qubit pure quantum state |ψ⟩ that has fidelity at least τ with some stabilizer state, we give an algorithm that outputs a succinct description of a stabilizer state that witnesses fidelity at least τ − ε. The algorithm uses O(n/(ε2τ4)) samples and exp(O(n/τ4)) / ε2 time. In the regime of τ constant, this algorithm estimates stabilizer fidelity substantially faster than the naive exp(O(n2))-time brute-force algorithm over all stabilizer states.  In the special case of τ &gt; cos2(π/8), we show that a modification of the above algorithm runs in polynomial time.  We exhibit a tolerant property testing algorithm for stabilizer states.  The underlying algorithmic primitive in all of our results is Bell difference sampling. To prove our results, we establish and/or strengthen connections between Bell difference sampling, symplectic Fourier analysis, and graph theory.},

abstract = {As current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices suffer from decoherence errors, any delay in the instruction execution of quantum control microarchitecture can lead to the loss of quantum information and incorrect computation results. Hence, it is crucial for the control microarchitecture to issue quantum operations to the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) in time. As in classical microarchitecture, parallelism in quantum programs needs to be exploited for speedup. However, three challenges emerge in the quantum scenario: 1) the quantum feedback control can introduce significant pipeline stall latency; 2) timing control is required for all quantum operations; 3) QPU requires a deterministic operation supply to prevent the accumulation of quantum errors. In this paper, we propose a novel control microarchitecture design to exploit Circuit Level Parallelism (CLP) and Quantum Operation Level Parallelism (QOLP). Firstly, we develop a Multiprocessor architecture to exploit CLP, which supports dynamic scheduling of different sub-circuits. This architecture can handle parallel feedback control and minimize the potential overhead that disrupts the timing control. Secondly, we propose a Quantum Superscalar approach that exploits QOLP by efficiently executing massive quantum instructions in parallel. Both methods issue quantum operations to QPU deterministically. In the benchmark test of a Shor syndrome measurement, a six-core implementation of our proposal achieves up to 2.59 \texttimes{} speedup compared with a single core. For various canonical quantum computing algorithms, our superscalar approach achieves an average of 4.04 \texttimes{} improvement over a baseline design. Finally, We perform a simultaneous randomized benchmarking (simRB) experiment on a real QPU using the proposed microarchitecture for validation.},

In information technology terms, biometrics is associated with technologies and techniques designed to secure and confirm identity based on individual, measurable biological characteristics of the person. Fingerprints can be used in systems and schemes designed to gain access to a computer, a room and, why not, a bank account. A verification system authenticates the person’s claimed identity by comparing the fingerprints provided by the person at a given point in time with the measures of these features previously stored in the system and associated with the person’s claimed identity. This paper presents a quantum matching algorithm for biometric fingerprints. For this, classical fingerprinting was encoded into quantum states using an adapted Novel Enhanced Quantum model and the quantum circuits, for storage and for matching, were implemented and tested on the IBM Quantum Experience platform and on a local virtual quantum simulator.},

This raises concerns regarding the stability of results when using NISQ devices since strategies for mitigating errors generally require well-characterized and stationary error models. Here, we quantify the reliability of NISQ devices by assessing the necessary conditions for generating stable results within a given tolerance. We use similarity metrics derived from device characterization data to derive and validate bounds on the stability of a 5-qubit implementation of the Bernstein-Vazirani&nbsp;algorithm. Simulation experiments conducted with noise data from IBM washington, spanning January 2022 to April 2023, revealed that the reliability metric fluctuated between 41% and 92%. This variation significantly surpasses the maximum allowable threshold of 2.2% needed for stable outcomes.

abstract = {The recent fast development of quantum computers breaks several computation limitations that are difficult for conventional computers. Up to the present, although many approaches and tools have been proposed to test quantum programs, the fundamental features of quantum programs, i.e., magnitude, phase, and entanglement, have been largely overlooked, leading to limited fault detection capability and reduced testing effectiveness. To address this problem, we propose an automated testing framework named QuraTest, equipped with three test case generators (including two newly proposed techniques, UCNOT and IQFT in this paper, as well as one based on Random techniques) to test quantum programs.Overall, the proposed generators enable the generation of diverse test inputs by considering the quantum features of quantum programs. In the experiments, we perform an in-depth evaluation of QuraTest from three aspects: generated test case diversity, output coverage of the program under test, and fault detection capability. The results demonstrate the potential of our newly proposed techniques in that IQFT can generate the most diverse test cases regarding magnitude, phase, and entanglement, with 66% cell coverage. Comparatively, the Random approach only has 10% cell coverage. Regarding the evaluations of the output coverage, IQFT can achieve the highest output coverage in 70.2% (33 out of 47) of all quantum programs. In terms of fault detection, UCNOT outperforms the other two techniques. Specifically, the test cases generated by UCNOT have the best mutation score in 88.4% (23 out of 26) quantum programs.},

abstract = {Classification is particularly relevant to Information Retrieval, as it is used in various subtasks of the search pipeline. In this work, we propose a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) for multi-class classification of classical data. The model is implemented using PennyLane. The optimization process is conducted by minimizing the cross-entropy loss through parameterized quantum circuit optimization. The QCNN is tested on the MNIST dataset with 4, 6, 8 and 10 classes. The results show that with 4 classes, the performance is slightly lower compared to the classical CNN, while with a higher number of classes, the QCNN outperforms the classical neural network.},

abstract = {This article presents a method for hardware trojan detection in integrated circuits. Unsupervised deep learning is used to classify wide field-of-view (4 \texttimes{} 4 mm2), high spatial resolution magnetic field images taken using a Quantum Diamond Microscope (QDM). QDM magnetic imaging is enhanced using quantum control techniques and improved diamond material to increase magnetic field sensitivity by a factor of &nbsp;4 and measurement speed by a factor of &nbsp;16 over previous demonstrations. These upgrades facilitate the first demonstration of QDM magnetic field measurement for hardware trojan detection. Unsupervised convolutional neural networks and clustering are used to infer trojan presence from unlabeled data sets of 600 \texttimes{} 600 pixel magnetic field images without human bias. This analysis is shown to be more accurate than principal component analysis for distinguishing between field programmable gate arrays configured with trojan-free and trojan-inserted logic. This framework is tested on a set of scalable trojans that we developed and measured with the QDM. Scalable and TrustHub trojans are detectable down to a minimum trojan trigger size of 0.5% of the total logic. The trojan detection framework can be used for golden-chip-free detection, since knowledge of the chips’ identities is only used to evaluate detection accuracy.},

abstract = {Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is a recent and rapidly evolving field where the theoretical framework and logic of quantum mechanics are employed to solve machine learning tasks. Various techniques with different levels of quantum-classical hybridization have been proposed. Here we focus on variational quantum circuits (VQC), which emerged as the most promising candidates for the quantum counterpart of neural networks in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Although showing promising results, VQCs can be hard to train because of different issues, e.g., barren plateau, periodicity of the weights, or choice of architecture. This paper focuses on this last problem for finding optimal architectures of variational quantum circuits for various tasks. To address it, we propose a gradient-free algorithm inspired by natural evolution to optimize both the weights and the architecture of the VQC. In particular, we present a version of the well-known neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) algorithm and adapt it to the case of variational quantum circuits. We refer to the proposed architecture search algorithm for VQC as QNEAT. We test the algorithm with different benchmark problems of classical fields of machine learning i.e. reinforcement learning and combinatorial optimization.},

Continuous progress on fundamental hardware technology promises to bring us more reliable and large-scale quantum computers on which to run the next generation of quantum algorithms. These programs are compiled and executed on dedicated platforms, and similarly to classical programs, a large effort is required to test these platforms and create a robust software toolchain.Unlike previous studies which focused on cross-optimization and cross-backend testing, this dissertation aims to create the first approach for cross-platform testing which compares execution on diverse quantum computing platforms. To inform the design of the method, we will first perform an empirical study of bugs in quantum computing platforms and a review of the characteristics of realistic quantum programs.The final approach for cross-platform testing will include three components: a learning-based method to generate realistic quantum programs, an approach to map and run them on multiple platforms, and finally a quantum-specific statistical test to compare two multivariate binary distributions returned as the output of quantum programs.},

However, there is no established baseline on which to judge current and future progress in equivalence checking of quantum circuits. In order to close this gap, we conduct a detailed case study of two of the most promising equivalence checking methodologies---one based on decision diagrams and one based on the ZX-calculus---and compare their strengths and weaknesses.},

While the preliminary evidences of its practical interest accumulate, there are numerous challenges that must be addressed before quantum computing can reach generalized adoption and realize its full potential. One such challenge concerns assessing whether a quantum program is correct, namely in the sense that it implements the desired functionality. In the classical realm, program testing is a well-established approach to find defects in programs. While this approach should inspire quantum software development, porting classical testing techniques to the quantum world is by no means trivial. We propose a novel approach to test quantum programs. Our approach is based on the use of metamorphic relations, which allows us to overcome the well-known quantum measurement problem. We describe a series of exploratory experiments whose results provide evidence of the usefulness of our approach.},

Thus, we propose an extension of cause-effect graphs, where quantum logic inspired functions (e.g., Hadamard) and their generalizations are defined and applied. Moreover, we present a metamodel describing various forms of cause-effect graphs. Finally, we demonstrate a possible method for generating test cases from a quantum cause-effect graph applied to a Bell state quantum program. Lastly, the design and utility of the resulting testing method is discussed, along with future prospects for general quantum cause-effect graphs.},

To tackle these challenges, we present a search-based approach, called Quantum Search-Based Testing (QuSBT), for automatically generating test suites of a given size that possibly expose failures of the quantum program under test. QuSBT encodes a test suite as a search individual, and tries to maximize the objective function that counts the number of failing tests in the test suite. Due to non-deterministic nature of quantum programs, the approach repeats the execution of each test multiple times, and uses suitable statistical tests to assess if a test passes or fails. QuSBT employs a genetic algorithm to perform the search. Experiments on 30 faulty quantum programs show that QuSBT is statistically better than random search, and is able to efficiently generate maximal failing test suites.This is an extended abstract of the paper [1]: X.

Reducing the circuit's execution time not only enhances its execution efficiency but also improves fidelity. However, finding the shortest execution time is NP-hard.In this work, we study the surface code mapping and scheduling problem. To reduce the execution time of a quantum circuit, we first introduce two novel metrics: Circuit Parallelism Degree and Chip Communication Capacity to quantitatively characterize quantum circuits and chips. Then, we propose a resource-adaptive mapping and scheduling method, named Ecmas, with customized initialization of chip resources for each circuit. Ecmas can dramatically reduce the execution time in both double defect and lattice surgery models. Furthermore, we provide an additional version Ecmas-ReSu for sufficient qubits, which is performance-guaranteed and more efficient. Extensive numerical tests on practical datasets show that Ecmas outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by reducing the execution time by 51.5% on average for double defect model. Ecmas can reach the optimal result in most benchmarks, reducing the execution time by up to 13.9% for lattice surgery model.},

abstract = {Fuzzing has achieved tremendous success in discovering bugs and vulnerabilities in various software systems. Systems under test (SUTs) that take in programming or formal language as inputs, e.g., compilers, runtime engines, constraint solvers, and software libraries with accessible APIs, are especially important as they are fundamental building blocks of software development. However, existing fuzzers for such systems often target a specific language, and thus cannot be easily applied to other languages or even other versions of the same language. Moreover, the inputs generated by existing fuzzers are often limited to specific features of the input language, and thus can hardly reveal bugs related to other or new features. This paper presents Fuzz4All, the first fuzzer that is universal in the sense that it can target many different input languages and many different features of these languages. The key idea behind Fuzz4All is to leverage large language models (LLMs) as an input generation and mutation engine, which enables the approach to produce diverse and realistic inputs for any practically relevant language. To realize this potential, we present a novel autoprompting technique, which creates LLM prompts that are well-suited for fuzzing, and a novel LLM-powered fuzzing loop, which iteratively updates the prompt to create new fuzzing inputs. We evaluate Fuzz4All on nine systems under test that take in six different languages (C, C++, Go, SMT2, Java, and Python) as inputs. The evaluation shows, across all six languages, that universal fuzzing achieves higher coverage than existing, language-specific fuzzers. Furthermore, Fuzz4All has identified 98 bugs in widely used systems, such as GCC, Clang, Z3, CVC5, OpenJDK, and the Qiskit quantum computing platform, with 64 bugs already confirmed by developers as previously unknown.},

abstract = {Reducing the width of quantum circuits is crucial due to limited number of qubits in quantum devices. This paper revisit an optimization strategy known as qubit recycling (alternatively wire-recycling or measurement- and-reset), which leverages gate commutativity to reuse discarded qubits, thereby reducing circuit width. We introduce qubit dependency graphs (QDGs) as a key abstraction for this optimization. With QDG, we isolate the computationally demanding components, and observe that qubit recycling is essentially a matrix triangularization problem. Based on QDG and this observation, we study qubit recycling with a focus on complexity, algorithmic, and verification aspects. Firstly, we establish qubit recycling’s NP-hardness through reduction from Wilf’s question, another matrix triangularization problem. Secondly, we propose a QDG-guided solver featuring multiple heuristic options for effective qubit recycling. Benchmark tests conducted on RevLib illustrate our solver’s superior or comparable performance to existing alternatives. Notably, it achieves optimal solutions for the majority of circuits. Finally, we develop a certified qubit recycler that integrates verification and validation techniques, with its correctness proof mechanized in Coq.},

The previous state of the art construction (in most parameter regimes) was the r-dimensional color code, which has only constant dimension K=O(1), and otherwise has the same parameters up to polylogarithmic factors. Our construction provides the first known codes with low-weight stabilizers that are capable of magic state distillation with arbitrarily small yield parameter γ=log(N/K)/log(D)&gt;0.  A classical analogue of transversal Cr−1Z gates is given by the multiplication property, which requires component-wise products of classical codewords to belong to another similar code. As a byproduct of our techniques, we also obtain a new construction of classical locally testable codes with such a multiplication property.  We construct our codes as products of chain complexes associated to classical LDPC codes, which in turn we obtain by imposing local Reed-Solomon codes on a specific spectral expander that we construct. We prove that our codes support the desired transversal Cr−1Z gates by using the multiplication property to combine local circuits based on the topological structure.},

abstract = {In a work by Raz (J. ACM and FOCS 16), it was proved that any algorithm for parity learning on n bits requires either Ω(n2) bits of classical memory or an exponential number (in ‍n) of random samples. A line of recent works continued that research direction and showed that for a large collection of classical learning tasks, either super-linear classical memory size or super-polynomially many samples are needed. All these works consider learning algorithms as classical branching programs, which perform classical computation within bounded memory. 	 However, these results do not capture all physical computational models, remarkably, quantum computers and the use of quantum memory. It leaves the possibility that a small piece of quantum memory could significantly reduce the need for classical memory or samples and thus completely change the nature of the classical learning task. Despite the recent research on the necessity of quantum memory for intrinsic quantum learning problems like shadow tomography and purity testing, the role of quantum memory in classical learning tasks remains obscure. 	 In this work, we study classical learning tasks in the presence of quantum memory. We prove that any quantum algorithm with both, classical memory and quantum memory, for parity learning on n bits, requires either Ω(n2) bits of classical memory or Ω(n) bits of quantum memory or an exponential number of samples. In other words, the memory-sample lower bound for parity learning remains qualitatively the same, even if the learning algorithm can use, in addition to the classical memory, a quantum memory of size c n (for some constant c&gt;0). 	 Our result is more general and applies to many other classical learning tasks. Following previous works, we represent by the matrix M: A \texttimes{} X → {−1,1} the following learning task. An unknown x is sampled uniformly at random from a concept class X, and a learning algorithm tries to uncover x by seeing streaming of random samples (ai, bi = M(ai, x)) where for every i, ai∈ A is chosen uniformly at random. Assume that k,ℓ,r are integers such that any submatrix of M of at least 2−k·|A| rows and at least 2−ℓ·|X| columns, has a bias of at most 2−r. We prove that any algorithm with classical and quantum hybrid memory for the learning problem corresponding to M needs either (1) Ω(k · ℓ) bits of classical memory, or (2) Ω(r) qubits of quantum memory, or (3) 2Ω(r) random samples, to achieve a success probability at least 2−O(r). 	 Our results refute the possibility that a small amount of quantum memory significantly reduces the size of classical memory needed for efficient learning on these problems. Our results also imply improved security of several existing cryptographical protocols in the bounded-storage model (protocols that are based on parity learning on n bits), proving that security holds even in the presence of a quantum adversary with at most c n2 bits of classical memory and c n bits of quantum memory (for some constant c&gt;0).},

abstract = {Software under test can be analyzed dynamically, while it is being executed, to find defects. However, as the number and possible values of input parameters increase, the cost of dynamic testing rises. This paper examines whether quantum computers (QCs) can help speed up the dynamic testing of programs written for classical computers (CCs). To accomplish this, an approach is devised involving the following three steps: (1) converting a classical program to a quantum program; (2) computing the number of inputs causing errors, denoted by K, using a quantum counting algorithm; and (3) obtaining the actual values of these inputs using Grover’s search algorithm. This approach can accelerate exhaustive and non-exhaustive dynamic testing techniques. On the CC, the computational complexity of these techniques is O(N), where N represents the count of combinations of input parameter values passed to the software under test. In contrast, on the QC, the complexity is O(ε−1 √N/K), where ε is a relative error of measuring K. The paper illustrates how the approach can be applied and discusses its limitations. Moreover, it provides a toy example executed on a simulator and an actual QC. This paper may be of interest to academics and practitioners as the approach presented in the paper may serve as a starting point for exploring the use of QC for dynamic testing of CC code.},

Therefore, quantum-circuit optimizers are applied to minimize the number of noisy operations. Today, physicists are constantly experimenting with novel devices and architectures. For every new physical substrate and for every modification of a quantum computer, we need to modify or rewrite major pieces of the optimizer to run successful experiments. In this paper, we present QUESO, an efficient approach for automatically synthesizing a quantum-circuit optimizer for a given quantum device. For instance, in 1.2 minutes, QUESO can synthesize an optimizer with high-probability correctness guarantees for IBM computers that significantly outperforms leading compilers, such as IBM's Qiskit and TKET, on the majority (85%) of the circuits in a diverse benchmark suite.A number of theoretical and algorithmic insights underlie QUESO: (1) An algebraic approach for representing rewrite rules and their semantics. This facilitates reasoning about complex symbolic rewrite rules that are beyond the scope of existing techniques. (2) A fast approach for probabilistically verifying equivalence of quantum circuits by reducing the problem to a special form of polynomial identity testing. (3) A novel probabilistic data structure, called a polynomial identity filter (PIF), for efficiently synthesizing rewrite rules. (4) A beam-search-based algorithm that efficiently applies the synthesized symbolic rewrite rules to optimize quantum circuits.},

abstract = {Feature modeling is a technique to model the variability of configurable systems. When working with feature models, it is possible to analyze them, for instance, by counting the number of valid configurations, searching feature model anomalies, or creating samples of configurations for testing. Classical feature model analysis techniques are based on solving algorithmic problems such as boolean satisfiability, satisfiability modulo theories, or integer linear programming. Existing analysis approaches provide satisfactory solutions for small and medium-sized problem instances, but scaling issues are observed for large-sized feature models. Quantum computers provide up to superpolynomial speedups for specific algorithmic problems and have the potential to solve those scaling issues. This paper analyzes the algorithmic techniques used in classical product line analysis and identifies potentials and challenges for quantum speedups. Our findings show that quantum algorithms like QAOA and Grover have the potential to speed up SAT and ILP-based feature model analysis techniques, but only after additional improvements in quantum hardware have been made.},

abstract = {Automation in quantum software testing is essential to support systematic and cost-effective testing. Towards this direction, we present a quantum software testing tool called Quito that can automatically generate test suites covering three coverage criteria defined on inputs and outputs of a quantum program coded in Qiskit, i.e., input coverage, output coverage, and input-output coverage. Quito also implements two types of test oracles based on program specifications, i.e., checking whether a quantum program produced a wrong output or checking a probabilistic test oracle with statistical test. We describe the architecture and methodology of the tool. We also validated the tool with one quantum program and one faulty version of it. Results indicate that Quito can generate test suites and perform test assessments that detect faults, and produce test results with a good time performance.Quito's code: https://github.com/Simula-COMPLEX/quitoQuito's video: https://youtu.be/kuI9QaCo8A8Artifact Available: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5288665},

abstract = {The trend towards optimization of quantum circuit simulators (QCS) has been driven by the rapid development of quantum computing, as there is a growing interest in creating high-efficiency QCS for quantum computing systems and applications. Despite this growth, the existing classical simulators pose challenges in simulating large quantum operations due to the exponential growth of memory and computation resources required. To overcome these issues, some studies have explored the use of non-volatile memory, such as solid-state disks (SSDs), to store a large amount of state vector while maintaining cost efficiency. However, such highly frequent read-and-write operations in large quantum simulations can quickly deplete the lifespan of SSDs, leading to overestimated practical efficiency and environmental concerns. Alternatively, Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) can be used to expand memory capacity, allowing computers in a network to access remote memories with low latency and high bandwidth. Therefore, we propose using one-sided RDMA operations along with a series of optimizations to expand memory capacity and efficiently maximize the utilization of unused memory assets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approaches can be practically scaled up without any lifespan consumption. The proposed optimization can get a 3.0x speedup compared to the local memory approach and a maximum speedup of 2.0x compared to the naive RDMA-based approach, as observed in our benchmark test.},

Increasing the qubit count to run meaningful quantum algorithms would require multiple traps where ions need to shuttle between traps to communicate.

In this paper, we target this gap and propose compiler optimizations to reduce the number of shuttles. Our technique achieves a maximum reduction of 51.17% in shuttles (average ~ 33%) tested over 125 circuits. Furthermore, the improved compilation enhances the program fidelity up to 22.68X with a modest increase in the compilation time.},

In QUELL, we use QELM for the waiting time prediction related to the scheduling software of elevators, with applications for software regression testing, elevator digital twins, and real-time performance prediction. The scheduling software is a classical software implemented by our industrial partner Orona, a globally recognized leader in elevator technology. We assess the performance of with four days of operational data of a real elevator installation with various feature sets and demonstrate that QUELL can efficiently predict waiting times, with prediction quality significantly better than that of classical ML models employed in a state-of-the-practice approach. Moreover, we show that the prediction quality of QUELL does not degrade when using fewer features. Based on our industrial application, we further provide insights into using QELM in other applications in Orona, and discuss how QELM could be applied to other industrial applications.},

High-quality and accessible QC resources are needed to help students develop the critical skills and confidence to contribute to the field. However, existing programs are often aimed at college students with an advanced mathematics or physics background, shutting out potential innovators.To make quantum learning resources for a broad, young audience, we designed Qupcakery, a puzzle game that introduces players to several core QC concepts: quantum gates, superposition, and measurement. We present preliminary testing results with both middle school and high school students. Using in-game data, observation notes, and focus group interviews, we identify student challenges and report student feedback. Overall, the game is at an appropriate level for high school students but middle school students need more levels to practice when new concepts are introduced.},

abstract = {Quantum algorithms often apply classical operations, such as arithmetic or predicate checks, over a quantum superposition of classical data; these so-called oracles are often the largest components of a quantum program. To ease the construction of efficient, correct oracle functions, this paper presents VQO, a high-assurance framework implemented with the Coq proof assistant. The core of VQO is OQASM, the oracle quantum assembly language. OQASM operations move qubits between two different bases via the quantum Fourier transform, thus admitting important optimizations, but without inducing entanglement and the exponential blowup that comes with it. OQASM’s design enabled us to prove correct VQO’s compilers—from a simple imperative language called OQIMP to OQASM, and from OQASM to SQIR, a general-purpose quantum assembly language—and allowed us to efficiently test properties of OQASM programs using the QuickChick property-based testing framework. We have used VQO to implement a variety of arithmetic and geometric operators that are building blocks for important oracles, including those used in Shor’s and Grover’s algorithms. We found that VQO’s QFT-based arithmetic oracles require fewer qubits, sometimes substantially fewer, than those constructed using “classical” gates; VQO’s versions of the latter were nevertheless on par with or better than (in terms of both qubit and gate counts) oracles produced by Quipper, a state-of-the-art but unverified quantum programming platform.},

However, such systems are vulnerable to quantum computer attacks. Thus, we improve the security of IoV-based post-quantum signatures, which can resist quantum computer attacks. The key operations are divisions in a finite field. Hence, we improve the security of IoV-based post-quantum signatures with division by employing systolic architectures. We propose a systolic architecture for computing division in composite fields. After that, we improve the IoT security-based post-quantum signatures with systolic divisions. We test and verify our design on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA); the experimental results confirm our estimates. Furthermore, the optimized method proposed can be further applied to various applications like solving system of linear equations and cryptographic applications for IoT security.},

One prominent example of such is the famous Kleene Algebra with Tests (KAT), which has furnished both theoretical insights and practical tools. The succinctness of algebraic reasoning would be especially desirable for scalable analysis of quantum programs, given the involvement of exponential-size matrices in most of the existing methods. A few key features of KAT including the idempotent law and the nice properties of classical tests, however, fail to hold in the context of quantum programs due to their unique quantum features, especially in branching. We propose Non-idempotent Kleene Algebra (NKA) as a natural alternative and identify complete and sound semantic models for NKA as well as their quantum interpretations. In light of applications of KAT, we demonstrate algebraic proofs in NKA of quantum compiler optimization and the normal form of quantum while-programs. Moreover, we extend NKA with Tests (i.e., NKAT), where tests model quantum predicates following effect algebra, and illustrate how to encode propositional quantum Hoare logic as NKAT theorems.},

abstract = {Quantum gates are building blocks of quantum circuits and they are used to carry out corresponding operations on quantum bits or qubits. The distinguishing feature of multi-qubit quantum control-gates is that they act on target qubits according to the state of control qubit(s). In this sense, there exist 2- and 3-qubit quantum gates such as Controlled-NOT, Toffoli (Controlled-Controlled-NOT), Controlled-Hadamard, Controlled-Swap and so on. In order to make complex quantum circuits easier and control more qubits, it is necessary to work out mathematical models of new control gates acting on more than three qubits depending on the state of control qubit. Therefore, in this work, mathematical model of multi-qubit universal control gate is worked out and some control gates are formulated in accordance with the proposed model, moreover the tests of these novel control gates are carried out using online open resource or virtual laboratory that is called “Quirk”. Existing 2- and 3-qubit control gates can also be derived using this model. Matrix representations of Controlled-NOT-NOT, Controlled-Hadamard-Hadamard, Controlled-NOT-NOT-Hadamard, Controlled-Hadamard-Swap and Controlled-Hadamard-SWAP-NOT gates are derived using the proposed mathematical model. These quantum gates are unitary and reversible gates. Using the proposed model and novel quantum gates will help to reduce complexity of quantum circuits and develop new cryptographic algorithms.},

This approach encourages a diverse skill set development, promotes creativity, critical thinking, and adaptability. It provides students with real-world applications for their theoretical knowledge, preparing them for careers that demand cross-disciplinary collaboration. It also instills a collaborative mindset that is increasingly essential in today's interconnected scientific landscape. Our intent is to develop a baseline model and then involve students during the summer research experience program. We also foresee developing a Computer Science-Physics cross listed undergraduate course for enriching student experience who are interested in these two disciplines. In this study, we will present our work in progress towards developing open-source software for astronomy image study and analysis. The flexibility of open-source development combined with a culture of innovation, leads to rapid improvements and the introduction of cutting-edge features. This software would provide a transparent mode for non-programmer users to not only view, stack, and overlay the raw image capture(s) but also do basic photometry and image statistics. The work in progress also involves the study of unsupervised learning to perform clustering analysis of the raw image capture(s). This analysis would group pixels or regions with similar characteristics, uncovering structures such as globular clusters, galaxies, or binary star systems. This process helps discern spatial relationships, identify outliers, and distinguish different celestial objects based on their inherent properties, such as brightness and shape. We are testing our open-source software with image data from a college telescope from Southern Connecticut State University. The telescope is a Spica Eyes Dobsonian reflecting telescope with an aperture size of 0.6m and focal ratio f/3.3. Transfer optics were added to increased our spatial resolution from 1.4 arcsec per pixel to 0.8 arcsec per pixel measurement. The transfer optics used a filter λ0 = 537nm that optimized quantum efficiency in the V-band. These images were taken July 2018 at Southern Connecticut State University (SCSU) in New Haven, CT where there is high artificial brightness and Bortle scale of 8. These images were taken in poor seeing conditions since the humidity was high due to the typical nature of costal Connecticut in the summer. Furthermore, tracking was not stable leading to target drift across the image plane. Figure 1(a) shows images from this observation session which include 8 frames of 0.05s exposure time with a readout speed of 2MHz of Jupiter. This shows how tracking and poor alignment can lead to images that are not resolved to show the details of Jupiter as seen in Figure 1(b). Stacking is necessary to improve the signal to noise ratio of the images as well as smooth out details. Without sufficient stacking, it will be difficult to distinguish details of the images.},

abstract = {Generating a test suite for a quantum program such that it has the maximum number of failing tests is an optimization problem. For such optimization, search-based testing has shown promising results in the context of classical programs. To this end, we present a test generation tool for quantum programs based on a genetic algorithm, called QuSBT (Search-based Testing of Quantum Programs). QuSBT automates the testing of quantum programs, with the aim of finding a test suite having the maximum number of failing test cases. QuSBT utilizes IBM's Qiskit as the simulation framework for quantum programs. We present the tool architecture in addition to the implemented methodology (i.e., the encoding of the search individual, the definition of the fitness function expressing the search problem, and the test assessment w.r.t. two types of failures). Finally, we report results of the experiments in which we tested a set of faulty quantum programs with QuSBT to assess its effectiveness.

Though some years likely still remain until significant quantum advantage is demonstrated, the development of the technology has led to a range of valuable resources. These include publicly available prototype quantum hardware, advanced simulators for small quantum programs and programming frameworks to test and develop quantum software. In this provocation paper we seek to demonstrate that these resources are sufficient to provide the first useful results in the field of procedural generation. This is done by introducing a proof-of-principle method: a quantum generalization of a blurring process, in which quantum interference is used to provide a unique effect. Through this we hope to show that further developments in the technology are not required before it becomes useful for procedural generation. Rather, fruitful experimentation with this new technology can begin now.},

It is therefore timely to investigate the resource requirements of quantum algorithms in a distributed setting, where multiple quantum processors are interconnected by a coherent network. We introduce an extension of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) to enable high-performance implementations of distributed quantum algorithms. In turn, these implementations can be used for testing, debugging, and resource estimation. In addition to a prototype implementation of quantum MPI, we present a performance model for distributed quantum computing, SENDQ. The model is inspired by the classical LogP model, making it useful to inform algorithmic decisions when programming distributed quantum computers. Specifically, we consider several optimizations of two quantum algorithms for problems in physics and chemistry, and we detail their effects on performance in the SENDQ model.},

Some of the most promising algorithms for these machines are variational algorithms that employ classical optimization coupled with quantum hardware to evaluate the quality of each candidate solution. Recent work used GRadient Descent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) to translate quantum programs into highly optimized machine control pulses, resulting in a significant reduction in the execution time of programs. This is critical, as quantum machines can barely support the execution of short programs before failing.However, GRAPE suffers from high compilation latency, which is untenable in variational algorithms since compilation is interleaved with computation. We propose two strategies for partial compilation, exploiting the structure of variational circuits to pre-compile optimal pulses for specific blocks of gates. Our results indicate significant pulse speedups ranging from 1.5x-3x in typical benchmarks, with only a small fraction of the compilation latency of GRAPE.},

abstract = {Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers consisting of tens of inherently noisy quantum bits (qubits) suffer from reliability problems. Qubits and their gates are susceptible to various types of errors. Due to limited numbers of qubits and high error rates, quantum error correction cannot be applied. Physical constraints of quantum hardware including the error rates are used to guide the design and the layout of quantum circuits. The error rates determine the selection of qubits and their operations. The resulting circuit is executed on the quantum computer.This study explores the risk of unexpected changes in the error rates of NISQ computers post-calibration. We show that unexpected changes in error rates can alter the output state of a quantum circuit. To detect these changes, we propose the insertion of test points into the quantum circuit to enable online monitoring of the physical qubit behavior. We utilize classical, superposition, and uncompute test points. Furthermore, we use a gate error coverage metric to assess the quality of the tests. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on different IBM quantum computers (IBM Q), in addition to a noisy simulation that shows the scalability of the proposed approach.},

The quantum-generated random data we tested showed very strong randomness, according to the NIST suite.Previously, IBM's quantum implementation required a single qubit for each bit of data generated in a circuit, making generation of large random numbers impractical.

The standard approach, based on solving Schr\"{o}dinger and Lindblad equations, is demanding when scaling the number of qubits in terms of both execution time and memory. In this article, attempts in defining compact models for the simulation of quantum hardware are proposed, ensuring results close to those obtained with standard formalism. Molecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance quantum hardware is the target technology, where three non-ideality phenomena—common to other quantum technologies—are taken into account: decoherence, off-resonance qubit evolution, and undesired qubit-qubit residual interaction. A model for each non-ideality phenomenon is embedded into a MATLAB simulation infrastructure of noisy quantum computers. The accuracy of the models is tested on a benchmark of quantum circuits, in the expected operating ranges of quantum hardware. The corresponding outcomes are compared with those obtained via numeric integration of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and the Qiskit’s QASMSimulator. The achieved results give evidence that this work is a step forward towards the definition of compact models able to provide fast results close to those obtained with the traditional physical simulation strategies, thus paving the way for their integration into a classical simulator of quantum computers.},

abstract = {In the universal blind quantum computation problem, a client wants to make use of a single quantum server to evaluate C|0⟩ where C is an arbitrary quantum circuit while keeping C secret. The client’s goal is to use as few resources as possible. This problem, first raised by Broadbent, Fitzsimons and Kashefi [FOCS 2009], has become fundamental to the study of quantum cryptography, not only because of its own importance, but also because it provides a testbed for new techniques that can be later applied to related problems (for example, quantum computation verification). Known protocols on this problem are mainly either information-theoretically (IT) secure or based on trapdoor assumptions (public key encryptions). In this paper we study how the availability of symmetric-key primitives, modeled by a random oracle, changes the complexity of universal blind quantum computation. We give a new universal blind quantum computation protocol. Similar to previous works on IT-secure protocols (for example, Broadbent-Fitzsimons-Kashefi), our protocol can be divided into two phases. In the first phase the client prepares some quantum gadgets with relatively simple quantum gates and sends them to the server, and in the second phase the client is entirely classical — it does not even need quantum storage. Crucially, the protocol’s first phase is succinct, that is, its complexity is independent of the circuit size. Given the security parameter κ, its complexity is only a fixed polynomial of κ, and can be used to evaluate any circuit (or several circuits) of size up to a subexponential of κ. In contrast, known schemes either require the client to perform quantum computations that scale with the size of the circuit, or require trapdoor assumptions.},

Several third-party compilers are improving the compilation times and depth/gate counts. Untrusted third parties or a particular version of a trusted compiler may allow an attacker to steal, clone, and/or reverse engineer the quantum circuit. We propose to obfuscate quantum circuits by employing dummy CNOT gates to prevent such threats. If the adversary clones the obfuscated design, he/she will get faulty results. We propose a metric-based dummy gate insertion process to ensure maximum corruption of functionality measured using Total Variation Distance (TVD) and validated using IBM’s noisy simulators. Our metric guided dummy gate insertion process achieves TVD of up to 28.83%, and performs 10.14% better than the average TVD and performs within 12.45% of the best obtainable TVD for the test benchmarks. The removal of dummy gates by the designer post-compilation to restore functionality as well as other finer details have been addressed.},

The problem is to find a good permutation without an exhaustive search. In this paper we propose a solution for this problem. The permutation problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. Solving the ILP problem, the lowest cost permutation for the CNOT mappings is guaranteed. To test and validated the proposed formulation, quantum architectures with 5 and 16 qubits were used. The ILP formulation along with mapping techniques found circuits with up to 64% fewer gates than other approaches.},

abstract = {Despite the current progress in quantum computing, the reliability of quantum computers is very challenging. Near-term quantum computers referred to as Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are expected to operate in the presence of errors. To run a quantum circuit on a NISQ computer, the circuit should be mapped to satisfy the physical constraints of the quantum architecture. The mapping process takes into account the error rates of the quantum hardware. It selects physical qubits and their movements, which minimize the circuit error rates. The output of the quantum circuit can be obtained through several runs on NISQ computers.What's important from a security perspective is that the output of the quantum circuit is inherently dependent on the error parameters of the quantum hardware. An adversary can, therefore, leverage such dependency to alter the functional behavior of the quantum circuit. We show that malicious changes in the error rates used for mapping quantum circuits can change their output. To detect this attack on NISQ architectures, we propose inserting test points into the quantum circuits to study their error rates with respect to other qubit allocations. We utilize superposition, classical, and un-compute tests to provide side-channel information of the quantum circuit. We study the effectiveness of our approach using IBMQ 16 Melbourne quantum computer and Qiskit tools as an exemplar.},

The repeat-until-success algorithm has to be run O(κ/(1-ε)) times to succeed, leveraging amplitude amplification, and needs to be sampled O(1/ε2) times. Thus, the algorithm achieves an exponential improvement with respect to N over classical methods. In particular, we present efficient oracles for state preparation, Hamiltonian simulation, and a set of observables together with the corresponding error and complexity analyses. As the main result of this work, we show how to use Richardson extrapolation to enhance Hamiltonian simulation, resulting in an implementation of Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) within the algorithm with 1/√ε circuits that can be run in parallel each with circuit complexity 1/√ ε  instead of 1/ε. Furthermore, we analyze necessary conditions for the overall algorithm to achieve an exponential speedup compared to classical methods. Our approach is not limited to the considered setting and can be applied to more general problems where Hamiltonian simulation is approximated via product formulae, although our theoretical results would need to be extended accordingly. All the procedures presented are implemented with Qiskit and tested for small systems using classical simulation as well as using real quantum devices available through the IBM Quantum Experience.},

Methods based on tensor networks or decision diagrams have proven to alleviate the inevitable exponential growth of the underlying complexity in many cases. But the complexity of these methods is very sensitive to so-called contraction plans or simulation paths, respectively, which define the order in which respective operations are applied. While, for tensor networks, a plethora of strategies has been developed, simulation based on decision diagrams is mostly conducted in a straight-forward fashion thus far. In this work, we envision a flow that allows to translate strategies from the domain of tensor networks to decision diagrams.

abstract = {It has been long known that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize the way we find solutions of problems that are difficult to solve on classical computers. It was only recently that small but functional quantum computers have become available on the cloud, allowing to test their potential. In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple. We discuss its effectiveness, limitations and possible future directions of development.},

abstract = {Mutation testing is often used for designing new tests, and involves changing a program in minor ways, which results in mutated versions of the program, i.e., mutants. An effective test suite should find faults (or kill mutants) with a minimum number of test cases, to save resources required for executing test cases. In this paper, in the context of mutation testing for quantum programs, we present a multi-objective and search-based approach (MutTG) to generate the minimum number of test cases killing as many mutants as possible. MutTG tries to estimate the likelihood that a mutant is equivalent, and uses this as a discount factor in the fitness definition to avoid keeping on trying to kill mutants that cannot be killed. We employed NSGA-II as the multi-objective search algorithm. Then, we compared MutTG with another version of the approach that does not use the discount factor in its fitness definition, and with random search (RS), over a set of open-source quantum programs and their mutants of varying complexity. Results show that the discount factor does indeed help in guiding the test generation, as the approach with the discount factor performs better than the one without it.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose Proq, a runtime assertion scheme for testing and debugging quantum programs on a quantum computer. The predicates in Proq are represented by projections (or equivalently, closed subspaces of the state space), following Birkhoff-von Neumann quantum logic. The satisfaction of a projection by a quantum state can be directly checked upon a small number of projective measurements rather than a large number of repeated executions. On the theory side, we rigorously prove that checking projection-based assertions can help locate bugs or statistically assure that the semantic function of the tested program is close to what we expect, for both exact and approximate quantum programs. On the practice side, we consider hardware constraints and introduce several techniques to transform the assertions, making them directly executable on the measurement-restricted quantum computers. We also propose to achieve simplified assertion implementation using local projection technique with soundness guaranteed. We compare Proq with existing quantum program assertions and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Proq by its applications to assert two sophisticated quantum algorithms, the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm and Shor’s algorithm.},

Our compilation tool development focuses on the fact that the error rates of individual qubits are not equal, with a goal of maximizing the success probability of real-world subroutines such as an adder circuit. We begin by establishing a metric for choosing among possible paths and circuit alternatives for executing gates between variables placed far apart within the processor, and test our approach on two IBM 20-qubit systems named Tokyo and Poughkeepsie. We find that a single-number metric describing the fidelity of individual gates is a useful but imperfect guide.Our compiler uses this subsystem and maps complete circuits onto the machine using a beam search-based heuristic that will scale as processor and program sizes grow. To evaluate the whole compilation process, we compiled and executed adder circuits, then calculated the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL-divergence, a measure of the distance between two probability distributions). For a circuit within the capabilities of the hardware, our compilation increases estimated success probability and reduces KL-divergence relative to an error-oblivious placement.},

abstract = {While showing great promise, circuit synthesis techniques that combine numerical optimization with search over circuit structures face scalability challenges due to a large number of parameters, exponential search spaces, and complex objective functions. The LEAP algorithm improves scaling across these dimensions using iterative circuit synthesis, incremental reoptimization, dimensionality reduction, and improved numerical optimization. LEAP draws on the design of the optimal synthesis algorithm QSearch by extending it with an incremental approach to determine constant prefix solutions for a circuit. By narrowing the search space, LEAP improves scalability from four to six qubit circuits. LEAP was evaluated with known quantum circuits such as QFT and physical simulation circuits like the VQE, TFIM, and QITE. LEAP can compile four qubit unitaries up to 59\texttimes{} faster than QSearch and five and six qubit unitaries with up to 1.2\texttimes{} fewer CNOTs compared to the QFAST package. LEAP can reduce the CNOT count by up to 36\texttimes{}, or 7\texttimes{} on average, compared to the CQC Tket compiler. Despite its heuristics, LEAP has generated optimal circuits for many test cases with a priori known solutions. The techniques introduced by LEAP are applicable to other numerical optimization based synthesis approaches.},

abstract = {Quantum computing harnesses quantum laws of nature to enable new types of algorithms, not efficiently possible on traditional computers, that may lead to breakthroughs in crucial areas like materials science and chemistry. There is rapidly growing demand for a quantum workforce educated in the basics of quantum computing. However, there have been very few offerings that help the learner to bridge the gap between the theoretical quantum computing knowledge and applying it to solving real-world problems.The Quantum Katas project has been designed specifically to reduce that gap. Each kata is a sequence of programming exercises that walk the learner through one or several closely related topics in quantum computing. The learner turns to the kata once they have studied the theory on this topic, to internalize their new knowledge. Each exercise requires writing a fragment of code in Q# - a quantum programming language. Most importantly, each kata includes a testing framework that provides immediate feedback for the attempted solutions, allowing the learner to study at their own pace even without access to instructor. This makes the project beneficial both for instructor-led studies and for self-learning. The Quantum Katas are an open-source project available at https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas.In this demo I will showcase the Quantum Katas and talk about our experience using them in a variety of learning environments, from guided university courses to workshops and study groups to self-paced learning.},

Existing fault models for QC, such as missing gate faults, are not suitable for quantum dot QC. This paper proposes realistic fault models and fault simulation for quantum dot QC. Our fault models are based on real physical phenomenon of quantum dot devices so that they represent real defect behavior or control errors. Our fault simulation does not need to fully expand gate matrices to 2n x 2n, where n is the number of qubits. Using sparse matrix multiplication, our fault simulation saves a lot of memory and CPU time. We also calculate the test repetition of each test pattern so that we can estimate our test time. Based on fault simulation of a full adder QC, we can select a small test set of six test patterns, totally 526 repetitions, to detect all faults with 99% confidence level.},

Despite extensive cryptographic support, current Java Cards do not support non-standard cryptographic algorithms such as post-quantum, secure-multiparty computations, and privacy-enhancing cryptographic schemes. Moreover, Java Card is restricted by the Application Programming Interface (API) in algebraic operations, which are the foundation of modern cryptographic schemes. This paper addresses the issue of developing these modern schemes by exploiting the limited cryptographic API provided by these types of cards. We show how to (ab)use the Java Card’s API to perform modular arithmetic operations, as well as basic operations on elliptic curves. Furthermore, we implement an attribute-based privacy-enhancing scheme on an off-the-shelf Java Card. To do so, we use our cryptographic API and several optimization techniques to make the scheme as efficient as possible. To demonstrate the practicality of our solution, we present the implementation results and benchmark tests.},

Compared to debugging classical programs, debugging quantum programs is difficult because programmers have limited ability to probe the internal states of quantum programs; those states are difficult to interpret even when observations exist; and programmers do not yet have guidelines for what to check for when building quantum programs. In this work, we present quantum program assertions based on statistical tests on classical observations. These allow programmers to decide if a quantum program state matches its expected value in one of classical, superposition, or entangled types of states. We extend an existing quantum programming language with the ability to specify quantum assertions, which our tool then checks in a quantum program simulator. We use these assertions to debug three benchmark quantum programs in factoring, search, and chemistry. We share what types of bugs are possible, and lay out a strategy for using quantum programming patterns to place assertions and prevent bugs.},

For a given circuit evaluated on a specific set of qubits, we evaluate: how frequently the qubits return an optimal solution to the problem, the fairness with which the qubits sample from all optimal solutions, and the reported hardware error rate of the qubits. To quantify fairness, we define a novel metric based on Pearson’s χ2 test. We find that fairness is relatively high for circuits with small and large error rates, but drops for circuits with medium error rates. This indicates that structured errors dominate in this regime, while unstructured errors, which are random and thus inherently fair, dominate in noisier qubits and longer circuits. Our results show that fairness can be a powerful tool for understanding the intricate web of errors affecting current NISQ hardware.},

The development of quantum electronics has led to the practical achievement of quantum devices that are already available on the market and waiting for their first application on a broader scale. A major aspect of quantum cryptography is the methodology of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), which is used to generate and distribute symmetric cryptographic keys between two geographically separate users using the principles of quantum physics. In previous years, several successful QKD networks have been created to test the implementation and interoperability of different practical solutions. This article surveys previously applied methods, showing techniques for deploying QKD networks and current challenges of QKD networking.

Lett. 68, 2981 (1992)] is used to show non-locality without inequalities, and it has been tested several times using optical circuits. We, for the first time, experimentally test Hardy’s paradox of non-locality in superconducting qubits. For practical verification of Hardy’s paradox, we argue that the error-modeling used in optical circuits is not useful for superconducting qubits. So, we propose a new error-modeling for Hardy’s paradox and a new method to estimate the lower bound on Hardy’s probability (i.e., the probability of a specific event in Hardy’s test) for superconducting qubits. Our results confirmed the theory that any non-maximally entangled state of two qubits violates Hardy’s equations; whereas, any maximally entangled state and product state of two qubits do not exhibit Hardy’s non-locality. Further, we point out the difficulties associated with the practical implementation of quantum protocols based on Hardy’s paradox and propose possible remedies. We also propose two performance measures for any two qubits of any quantum computer based on superconducting qubits.},

We present a complete characterization of the phase shifter elements for an effective on-chip PIC interaction. To induce a consistent phase shift still retaining coherence of light, we act on the phase-shifters by means of a closed-loop control.

abstract = {Single flux quantum (SFQ) circuits as an example of superconducting electronics (SCE) have the potential to replace CMOS circuits as they possess a theoretical potential of three orders of magnitude reduction in power accompanied with one order of magnitude higher speed. Despite its benefits, the SCE community lacks a reliable open source formal verification solution. This paper proposes a verification framework called qMC, a model checker for SFQ circuits using formal techniques. qMC offers an automated process that constructs a SystemVerilog testbench consisting of formal assertions to verify the SFQ-specific properties of the circuits and produce system correctness results and counterexamples using model checking (MC). Instead of creating an MC tool from scratch, we have built qMC based on well established open source back-end verification engines for MC of CMOS circuits, including Yosys-SMTBMC and EBMC. qMC allows for properties to be given in SystemVerilog formal assertions, time-limited SystemVerilog assertions, or linear temporal logic (LTL). qMC provides an improvement in terms of verification time and coverage when compared to state-of-the-art semi-formal based SFQ verification frameworks. For instance, verification time for a 4-bit array multiplier is sped up by 19.5x.},

First, quantum circuits for the main components of S-AES in the finite field F2[x]/(x4 + x + 1), are constructed. Then, the constructed circuits are put together to form a quantum version of S-AES. A C-NOT synthesis is used to decompose some of the functions to reduce the number of the needed qubits. The quantum S-AES is integrated into a black-box queried by Grover's algorithm. A new approach is proposed to uniquely recover the secret key when Grover attack is applied. The entire work is simulated and tested on a quantum mechanics simulator. The complexity analysis shows that a block cipher can be designed as a quantum circuit with a polynomial cost. In addition, the secret key is recovered in quadratic speedup as promised by Grover's algorithm.},

abstract = {In the near future, there will likely be special-purpose quantum computers with 40--50 high-quality qubits. This paper lays general theoretical foundations for how to use such devices to demonstrate "quantum supremacy": that is, a clear quantum speedup for some task, motivated by the goal of overturning the Extended Church-Turing Thesis as confidently as possible.First, we study the hardness of sampling the output distribution of a random quantum circuit, along the lines of a recent proposal by the Quantum AI group at Google. We show that there's a natural average-case hardness assumption, which has nothing to do with sampling, yet implies that no polynomial-time classical algorithm can pass a statistical test that the quantum sampling procedure's outputs do pass. Compared to previous work -- for example, on BosonSampling and IQP -- the central advantage is that we can now talk directly about the observed outputs, rather than about the distribution being sampled.Second, in an attempt to refute our hardness assumption, we give a new algorithm, inspired by Savitch's Theorem, for simulating a general quantum circuit with n qubits and depth d in polynomial space and dO(n) time. We then discuss why this and other known algorithms fail to refute our assumption.Third, resolving an open problem of Aaronson and Arkhipov, we show that any strong quantum supremacy theorem -- of the form "if approximate quantum sampling is classically easy, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses"-- must be non-relativizing. This sharply contrasts with the situation for exact sampling.Fourth, refuting a conjecture by Aaronson and Ambainis, we show that there is a sampling task, namely Fourier Sampling, with a 1 versus linear separation between its quantum and classical query complexities.Fifth, in search of a "happy medium" between black-box and non-black-box arguments, we study quantum supremacy relative to oracles in P/poly. Previous work implies that, if one-way functions exist, then quantum supremacy is possible relative to such oracles. We show, conversely, that some computational assumption is needed: if SampBPP = SampBQP and NP ⊆ BPP, then quantum supremacy is impossible relative to oracles with small circuits.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) firmware upgrade has turned out to be a challenging task with respect to security. While Over-The-Air (OTA) software upgrade possibility is an essential feature to achieve security, it is also most sensitive to attacks and lots of different firmware upgrade attacks have been presented in the literature. Several security solutions exist to tackle these problems. We observe though that most prior art solutions are public key-based, they are not flexible with respect to firmware image distribution principles and it is challenging to make a design with good Denial-Of-Service (DoS) attacks resistance. Apart from often being rather resource demanding, a limitation with current public key-based solutions is that they are not quantum computer resistant. Hence, in this paper, we take a new look into the firmware upgrade problem and propose RoSym, a secure, firmware distribution principle agnostic, and DoS protected upgrade mechanism purely based on symmetric cryptography. We present an experimental evaluation on a real testbed environment for the scheme. The results show that the scheme is efficient in comparison to other state of the art solutions. We also make a formal security verification of RoSym showing that it is robust against different attacks.},

abstract = {Key exchange protocols and key encapsulation mechanisms establish secret keys to communicate digital information confidentially over public channels. Lattice-based cryptography variants of these protocols are promising alternatives given their quantum-cryptanalysis resistance and implementation efficiency. Although lattice cryptosystems can be mathematically secure, their implementations have shown side-channel vulnerabilities. But such attacks largely presume collecting multiple measurements under a fixed key, leaving the more dangerous single-trace attacks unexplored. This article demonstrates successful single-trace power side-channel attacks on lattice-based key exchange and encapsulation protocols. Our attack targets both hardware and software implementations of matrix multiplications used in lattice cryptosystems. The crux of our idea is to apply a horizontal attack that makes hypotheses on several intermediate values within a single execution all relating to the same secret, and to combine their correlations for accurately estimating the secret key. We illustrate that the design of protocols combined with the nature of lattice arithmetic enables our attack. Since a straightforward attack suffers from false positives, we demonstrate a novel extend-and-prune procedure to recover the key by following the sequence of intermediate updates during multiplication. We analyzed two protocols, Frodo and FrodoKEM, and reveal that they are vulnerable to our attack. We implement both stand-alone hardware and RISC-V based software realizations and test the effectiveness of the proposed attack by using concrete parameters of these protocols on physical platforms with real measurements. We show that the proposed attack can estimate secret keys from a single power measurement with over 99% success rate.},

abstract = {In the search for post-quantum secure alternatives to RSA and ECC, lattice-based cryptography appears to be an attractive and efficient option. A particularly interesting lattice-based signature scheme is BLISS, offering key and signature sizes in the range of RSA moduli. A range of works on efficient implementations of BLISS is available, and the scheme has seen a first real-world adoption in strongSwan, an IPsec-based VPN suite. In contrast, the implementation-security aspects of BLISS, and lattice-based cryptography in general, are still largely unexplored.At CHES 2016, Groot Bruinderink et al. presented the first side-channel attack on BLISS, thus proving that this topic cannot be neglected. Nevertheless, their attack has some limitations. First, the technique is demonstrated via a proof-of-concept experiment that was not performed under realistic attack settings. Furthermore, the attack does not apply to BLISS-B, an improved variant of BLISS and also the default option in strongSwan. This problem also applies to later works on implementation security of BLISS.In this work, we solve both of the above problems. We present a new side-channel key-recovery algorithm against both the original BLISS and the BLISS-B variant. Our key-recovery algorithm draws on a wide array of techniques, including learning-parity with noise, integer programs, maximimum likelihood tests, and a lattice-basis reduction. With each application of a technique, we reveal additional information on the secret key culminating in a complete key recovery.Finally, we show that cache attacks on post-quantum cryptography are not only possible, but also practical. We mount an asynchronous cache attack on the production-grade BLISS-B implementation of strongSwan. The attack recovers the secret signing key after observing roughly 6000 signature generations.},

abstract = {The Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron (AQFP) superconducting technology has been recently developed, which achieves the highest energy efficiency among superconducting logic families, potentially 104--105 gain compared with state-of-the-art CMOS. In 2016, the successful fabrication and testing of AQFP-based circuits with the scale of 83,000 JJs have demonstrated the scalability and potential of implementing large-scale systems using AQFP. As a result, it will be promising for AQFP in high-performance computing and deep space applications, with Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference acceleration as an important example.Besides ultra-high energy efficiency, AQFP exhibits two unique characteristics: the deep pipelining nature since each AQFP logic gate is connected with an AC clock signal, which increases the difficulty to avoid RAW hazards; the second is the unique opportunity of true random number generation (RNG) using a single AQFP buffer, far more efficient than RNG in CMOS. We point out that these two characteristics make AQFP especially compatible with the stochastic computing (SC) technique, which uses a time-independent bit sequence for value representation, and is compatible with the deep pipelining nature. Further, the application of SC has been investigated in DNNs in prior work, and the suitability has been illustrated as SC is more compatible with approximate computations.This work is the first to develop an SC-based DNN acceleration framework using AQFP technology. The deep-pipelining nature of AQFP circuits translates into the difficulty in designing accumulators/counters in AQFP, which makes the prior design in SC-based DNN not suitable. We overcome this limitation taking into account different properties in CONV and FC layers: (i) the inner product calculation in FC layers has more number of inputs than that in CONV layers; (ii) accurate activation function is critical in CONV rather than FC layers. Based on these observations, we propose (i) accurate integration of summation and activation function in CONV layers using bitonic sorting network and feedback loop, and (ii) low-complexity categorization block for FC layers based on chain of majority gates. For complete design we also develop (i) ultra-efficient stochastic number generator in AQFP, (ii) a high-accuracy sub-sampling (pooling) block in AQFP, and (iii) majority synthesis for further performance improvement and automatic buffer/splitter insertion for requirement of AQFP circuits. Experimental results suggest that the proposed SC-based DNN using AQFP can achieve up to 6.8 \texttimes{} 104 times higher energy efficiency compared to CMOS-based implementation while maintaining 96% accuracy on the MNIST dataset.},

abstract = {In this article, we introduce a novel method of synthesizing symmetric Boolean functions with reversible logic gates. In contrast to earlier approaches, the proposed technique deploys a simple, regular, and cascaded structure consisting of an array of Peres and CNOT gates, which results in significant reduction with respect to the quantum cost. However, the number of circuit inputs may increase slightly when such cascades are used. In order to reduce their number, we next propose a postsynthesis optimization phase that allows judicious reuse of circuit lines. In addition to offering a cost-effective synthesis methodology, the proposed reversible logic structure supports elegant testability properties. With respect to all single or partial missing gate faults (SMGFs and PMGFs), or repeated gate faults (RGFs) in such an n-input circuit module, we show that it admits a universal test set of constant cardinality (=3) for any value of n. Thus, considering both the cost and testability issues, this approach provides a superior option for synthesizing symmetric functions compared to existing designs.},

abstract = {QMCPACK is open source scientific software designed to perform Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation, a first-principles method for describing many-body systems. The evaluation of each Monte Carlo move requires finding the determinant of a dense matrix in the wave functions. This calculation forms a key computational kernel in QMCPACK. After each accepted event, the wave function matrix undergoes a rank-one update to represent a single particle move within the system. The matrix inverse is updated via the Sherman-Morrison formula; occasionally, the explicit inverse must be recomputed to maintain numerical stability.; We propose an alternate approach to this kernel that utilizes QR factorization to maintain stability without refactorization. In addition, algorithms based on a novel delayed update scheme are explored in this effort. This strategy enables probability evaluation for multiple successive Monte Carlo moves, with application of accepted moves to the wave function matrix delayed until an event is denied, or a predetermined limit on acceptances p is reached. Accepted events grouped in this manner are then applied to the matrix en bloc with enhanced arithmetic intensity and computational efficiency.Delayed update Sherman-Morrison probability evaluation algorithms with CPU and GPU-accelerated implementations are tested, profiled, and analyzed. A QR based delayed update algorithm remains in development. Results are evaluated against existing methods for numerical stability and efficiency; emphasis is placed on large systems, for which acceleration is critical.},
