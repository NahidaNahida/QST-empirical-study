 abstract = {Software reliability growth model (SRGM) with testing-effort function (TEF) is very helpful for software developers and has been widely accepted and applied. However, each SRGM with TEF ( SRGMTEF) contains some undetermined parameters. Optimization of these parameters is a necessary task. Generally, these parameters are estimated by the Least Square Estimation (LSE) or the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). We found that the MLE can be used only when the software failure data to satisfy some assumptions such as to satisfy a certain distribution. However, the software failure data may not satisfy such a distribution. In this paper, we investigate the improvement and application of a swarm intelligent optimization algorithm, namely quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, to optimize these parameters of SRGMTEF. The performance of the proposed SRGMTEF model with optimized parameters is also compared with other existing models. The experiment results show that the proposed parameter optimization approach using QPSO is very effective and flexible, and the better software reliability growth performance can be obtained based on SRGMTEF on the different software failure datasets.

 abstract = {Practical quantum computing is rapidly becoming a reality. To harness quantum computers' real potential in software applications, one needs to have an in-depth understanding of all such characteristics of quantum computing platforms (QCPs), relevant from the Software Engineering (SE) perspective. Restrictions on copying, deletion, the transmission of qubit states, a hard dependency on quantum algorithms are few, out of many, examples of QCP characteristics that have significant implications for building quantum software.Thus, developing quantum software requires a paradigm shift in thinking by software engineers. This paper presents the key findings from the SE perspective, resulting from an in-depth examination of state-of-the-art QCPs available today. The main contributions that we present include i) Proposing a general architecture of the QCPs, ii) Proposing a programming model for developing quantum software, iii) Determining architecturally significant characteristics of QCPs, and iv) Determining the impact of these characteristics on various Quality Attributes (QAs) and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) activities.We show that the nature of QCPs makes them useful mainly in specialized application areas such as scientific computing. Except for performance and scalability, most of the other QAs (e.g., maintainability, testability, and reliability) are adversely affected by different characteristics of a QCP.},

Moreover, we define two types of test oracles, together with a procedure to determine the passing and failing of test suites with statistical analyses. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the three coverage criteria, we conducted experiments with five quantum programs. We used mutation analysis to determine the coverage criteria' effectiveness and cost in terms of the number of test cases.

 abstract = {Combinatorial testing (CT) can efficiently detect failures caused by interactions of parameters of software under test. The CT study has undergone a transition from traditional CT to constrained CT, which is crucial for real-world systems testing. Under this scenario, constrained covering array generation (CCAG), a vital combinatorial optimisation issue targeted with constructing a test suite of minimal size while properly addressing constraints, remains challenging in CT. To the authors' best knowledge, this paper presents a synergic method first based on quantum particle swarm optimisation (QPSO) for the CCAG problems. Three auxiliary strategies, including contraction-expansion coefficient adaptive change strategy, differential evolution strategy, and discretisation strategy, are proposed to improve the performance of QPSO. Meanwhile, the improved QPSO method combines with the three different constraint handling strategies and an enhanced one-test-at-a-time strategy as a synergic QPSO method named QPIO to solve the CCAG problem. In the experiment, we investigate the impacts of parameter settings on the performance of the QPIO. Extensive experimental results show that the QPIO algorithm is a competitive method compared to the representative methods for CCAG. Besides, the QPIO method enriches the application of the QPSO algorithm in the context of CT.},

 abstract = {Regression testing is essential for continuous integration and continuous development. It is needed to ensure that the modifications have not produced any errors or faults, thereby maintaining the quality and reliability of the software. The testers usually avoid exhaustive retesting because it requires lots of effort and time. The test case prioritization and minimization solve the issue by scheduling the critical test cases and removing redundant ones. Optimization techniques help by improving the efficiency of these techniques while utilizing limited resources. This paper proposed an enhanced discrete novel bat algorithm for the test case prioritization. The algorithm is modified in two ways. First, we have proposed a fix-up mechanism for the discrete combinatorial problem, which conducts the perturbation in the population using the asexual reproduction algorithm. Second, the novel bat algorithm is improved, where the bats hunt in different habitats with quantum behavior using Gaussian distribution and search in the limited habitat with Doppler effect. In addition, we have embedded the test case minimization procedure in the algorithm for redundancy reduction. The experimental results are empirically analyzed using different testing criteria, i.e., fault and statement coverage on three subject programs from the software infrastructure repository. Consequently, test selection percentage, coverage loss, fault detection loss, and cost reduction percentages are deduced for the test case minimization at program and version levels. Empirical results and statistical comparisons with the random search, bat algorithm, novel bat algorithm, birds swarm algorithm, whale optimization algorithm, and genetic algorithm show the outperformance of the proposed algorithm.},

The design of quantum software nevertheless poses two main challenges: the modelling of software quantum elements must be done in high-level modelling languages; and the need to further develop so-called hybrid information systems, which combine quantum and classical software. To address these challenges, we first propose a quantum UML profile for analysing and designing hybrid information systems; we then demonstrate its applicability through various structural and behavioural diagrams such as use case, class, sequence, activity, and deployment. In comparison to certain other quantum domain-specific languages, this UML profile ensures compliance with a well-known international standard that is supported by many tools and is followed by an extensive community.},

It is essential in the software development process and needs a huge quantity of resources such as labor, money, and time. Automated software testing can be used to save manual work, shorten testing times, and improve testing performance. Recently, Software Bug Prediction (SBP) models have been developed to improve the software quality assurance (SQA) process through the prediction of bug parts. Advanced deep learning (DL) models can be used to classify faults in software parts. Because hyperparameters have a significant impact on the performance of any DL model, a proper hyperparameter optimization approach utilizing metaheuristic methods is required. This paper provides a unique Metaheuristic Optimization with Deep Learning based SBP (MODL-SBP) methodology to ensure software dependability and trustworthiness. The suggested technique entails creating a hybrid Convolution Neural Network (CNN) bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) to forecast software problems. Furthermore, the Chaotic Quantum Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (CQGOA) is used for hyperparameter optimization of the CNN-BiLSTM models, which enhances predictive accuracy. To demonstrate the superior performance of the MODL-SBP technique, a wide range of simulations are performed on benchmark datasets, with the results highlighting the superior performance of the proposed model over other recent techniques.},

 abstract = {The capability of Quantum Computing (QC) in solving complex problems has been increasingly recognized. However, similar to classical computing, to fully exploit QC's potential, it is important to ensure the correctness of quantum programs. Doing so via software testing is, however, very challenging because of QC's inherent properties: superposition and entanglement. Towards the direction of ensuring the correctness of quantum programs, we propose an approach called QuCAT (QUantum CombinAtorial Testing) for systematic and automated testing of quantum programs by benefiting from combinatorial testing, which has been proven to be cost-effective in testing classical programs. QuCAT supports two combinatorial test suite generation scenarios, i.e., generating combinatorial test suites of a given strength, and incrementally generating and executing combinatorial test suites of increasing strength until a fault is found. The approach employs two types of test oracles to assess test results. We performed an empirical study with 18 faulty versions of quantum programs to evaluate QuCAT with strengths of two, three, and four in the two test generation scenarios. We compare the cost-effectiveness of combinatorial testing of various strengths and random testing (taken as baseline approach). Results show that combinatorial testing always performs better than random testing with the same cost and finds faults more quickly (in terms of required number of test cases). In addition, in most cases, combinatorial testing with a higher strength outperforms the lower strength in terms of effectiveness.},

 abstract = {Quantum computing is expected to introduce the next era of computing speed and power, and its software - quantum program is gaining increasing research interest in the software engineering community. A significant characteristic of quantum computing is the existence of noise. Unlike classical computers where the output of a program is usually deterministic, the execution of a quantum program may be affected by quantum noise. Such a difference may cause difficulties or misunderstandings for developers shifting from classical programming to quantum programming. To understand the impact of quantum noise on quantum programs and its implications for software developers, we conduct a series of studies with real-world quantum programs and quantum computing environments. Specifically, we first measure and analyze the noise in a real quantum computer by testing it with a basic quantum program. We find that a non-neglectable amount of quantum noise generally exists in real quantum computers. Then we investigate the robustness of quantum programs against different quantum noises by testing 18 real -world quantum programs and 50,000 randomly generated quantum circuits in simulated and real environments. We observe that quantum noise can significantly influence the correctness of quantum programs, and different quantum circuit structures show diverse sensitivity patterns under the same noise. Based on the observations, we build a machine learning model to predict the fidelity of a quantum program under certain quantum noise. The model achieves a small average fidelity prediction error, meaning the impact of noise can be precisely estimated statistically.},

The architecture of software-intensive systems can empower architects who can leverage architecture-centric processes, practices, description languages to model, develop, and evolve quantum computing software (quantum software for short) at higher abstraction levels. We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate (i) architectural process, (ii) modelling notations, (iii) architecture design patterns, (iv) tool support, and (iv) challenging factors for quantum software architecture. Results of the SLR indicate that quantum software represents a new genre of software-intensive systems; however, existing processes and notations can be tailored to derive the architecting activities and develop modelling languages for quantum software. Quantum bits (Qubits) mapped to Quantum gates (Qugates) can be represented as architectural components and connectors that implement quantum software. Tool-chains can incorporate reusable knowledge and human roles (e.g., quantum domain engineers, quantum code developers) to automate and customise the architectural process. Results of this SLR can facilitate researchers and practitioners to develop new hypotheses to be tested, derive reference architectures, and leverage architecture-centric principles and practices to engineer emerging and next generations of quantum software.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

However, the quantum potential is not only a matter of hardware, but also of software. Therefore, this new paradigm has an impact yet to be explored on software development processes and techniques, and the adaptation of classical software engineering to the new classical/quantum hybrid systems raises a number of important challenges: a new Quantum Software Engineering is therefore needed. Specifically, and focusing on quantum software quality, software verification remains an open research question, as its novelty and complexity make quantum software development a particularly error-prone process. Most current approaches to test-driven verification rely heavily on simulations, which is a problem due to the lack of scalability of simulators running on classical computers. To address this shortcoming, we define the concept of a Quantum Test Case, and then present a method to test quantum circuits on real machines, without using simulation test functionalities such as amplitude calculation or non-destructive measurement. This is achieved by automatically generating a Quantum Test Case, which wraps the circuit under test and performs the verification. We also present the process to run a set of tests on a circuit with this method, along with an example to illustrate the technique.},

Additionally, the study aims to explore the research community's interest in QSE, how it has evolved, and any prior contributions to the discipline before its formal introduction through the Talavera Manifesto.

Results: We found that QSE research has primarily focused on software testing, with little attention given to other topics, such as software engineering management. The most commonly studied technology for techniques and tools is Qiskit, although, in most studies, either multiple or none specific technologies were employed. The researchers most interested in QSE are interconnected through direct collaborations, and several strong collaboration clusters have been identified.

These models are supported by a set of foundation libraries for code development.

This paper presents Upbeat, a fuzzing tool to generate random test cases for bugs related to input-checking in Q# libraries. Upbeat develops an automated process to extract constraints from the API documentation and the developer-implemented input-checking statements. It leverages open-source Q# code samples to synthesize test programs. It frames the test case generation as a constraint satisfaction problem for classical computing and a quantum state model for quantum computing to produce carefully generated subroutine inputs to test if the input-checking mechanism is appropriately implemented. Under 100 hours of automated test runs, Upbeat has successfully identified 16 bugs in API implementations and 4 documentation errors. Of these, 14 have been confirmed, and 12 have been fixed by the library developers.},

 abstract = {Quantum Computing (QC) promises computational speedup over classic computing. However, noise exists in near-term quantum computers. Quantum software testing (for gaining confidence in quantum software's correctness) is inevitably impacted by noise, i.e., it is impossible to know if a test case failed due to noise or real faults. Existing testing techniques test quantum programs without considering noise, i.e., by executing tests on ideal quantum computer simulators. Consequently, they are not directly applicable to test quantum software on real quantum computers or noisy simulators. Thus, we propose a noise-aware approach (named $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN) to alleviate the noise effect on test results of quantum programs. $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN employs machine learning techniques (e.g., transfer learning) to learn the noise effect of a quantum computer and filter it from a program's outputs. Such filtered outputs are then used as the input to perform test case assessments (determining the passing or failing of a test case execution against a test oracle). We evaluated $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN on IBM's 23 noise models, Google's two available noise models, and Rigetti's Quantum Virtual Machine, with six real-world and 800 artificial programs. We also generated faulty versions of these programs to check if a failing test case execution can be determined under noise. Results show that $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN can reduce the noise effect by more than $80\%$80% on most noise models. We used an existing test oracle to evaluate $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN's effectiveness in quantum software testing. The results showed that $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN attained scores of $99\%$99%, $75\%$75%, and $86\%$86% for precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively, for the test oracle across six real-world programs. For artificial programs, $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN achieved scores of $93\%$93%, $79\%$79%, and $86\%$86% for precision, recall, and F1-score respectively. This highlights $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN's effectiveness in learning noise patterns for noise-aware quantum software testing.},

However, to solve TCO problems for large-scale and complex software systems, substantial computational resources are required. Quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOAs) are promising combinatorial optimization algorithms that rely on quantum computational resources, with the potential to offer increased efficiency compared to classical approaches. Several proof-of-concept applications of QAOAs for solving combinatorial problems, such as portfolio optimization, energy optimization in power systems, and job scheduling, have been proposed. Given the lack of investigation into QAOA's application for TCO problems, and motivated by the computational challenges of TCO problems and the potential of QAOAs, we present IGDec-QAOA to formulate a TCO problem as a QAOA problem and solve it on both ideal and noisy quantum computer simulators, as well as on a real quantum computer. To solve bigger TCO problems that require many qubits, which are unavailable these days, we integrate a problem decomposition strategy with the QAOA. We performed an empirical evaluation with five TCO problems and four publicly available industrial datasets from ABB, Google, and Orona to compare various configurations of IGDec-QAOA, assess its decomposition strategy of handling large datasets, and compare its performance with classical algorithms (i.e., Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Random Search). Based on the evaluation results achieved on an ideal simulator, we recommend the best configuration of our approach for TCO problems. Also, we demonstrate that our approach can reach the same effectiveness as GA and outperform GA in two out of five test case optimization problems we conducted. In addition, we observe that, on the noisy simulator, IGDec-QAOA achieved similar performance to that from the ideal simulator. Finally, we also demonstrate the feasibility of IGDec-QAOA on a real quantum computer in the presence of noise.},

Although very effective, traditional test suite optimization techniques are often impractical in resource-constrained scenarios, as they are computationally expensive. Hence, quantum computing solutions have been developed to improve their efficiency, but have shown drawbacks in terms of effectiveness. We propose reformulating the regression test case selection problem to use quantum computation techniques better. Our objectives are (i) to provide more efficient solutions than traditional methods and (ii) to improve the effectiveness of previously proposed quantum-based solutions. We propose SelectQA, a quantum annealing approach that can outperform the quantum-based approach BootQA in terms of effectiveness while obtaining results comparable to those of the classic Additional Greedy and DIV-GA approaches. Regarding efficiency, SelectQA outperforms DIV-GA and has similar results with the Additional Greedy algorithm, but is exceeded by BootQA.},

 abstract = {The current quantum landscape is characterised by a wide variety of quantum computers, each with unique capabilities and limitations. Despite its rapid advancement, this field is still in its early stages and lacks essential software engineering principles such as resilience and customisability by design. To provide developers with a quantum technology stack that embeds these principles by design, we propose leveraging the heterogeneity of existing quantum computers. Specifically, we introduce a novel distribution methodology, termed shot-wise, to distribute the quantum computation workload of a single circuit execution (i.e., its shots) across multiple quantum computers. This shot-wise methodology is highly customisable, allowing for the embedding of user-specific and scenario-specific requirements into the distribution process. Requirements can be expressed through constraints, such as the geographical location of the QPUs, and their architecture, or ensuring or avoiding specific combinations of QPUs and quantum providers. Additionally, requirements can be defined by one or more objective functions to be minimised or maximised, such as reducing waiting time, computation cost, or energy footprint. By also combining constraints and objective functions, our shot-wise methodology enhances flexibility and improves the overall resilience of quantum computations against potential quantum computer failures. Preliminary results indicate that this approach offers error rates comparable to, or lower than, those of single-device execution even in all the tested scenarios with different numbers of qubits, families of circuits and number of QPUs to distribute the shots.},

Our framework is more developer-friendly than other modern QCS frameworks in three aspects: (1) Qsyn provides a comprehensive command -line interface that enables developers to design various testing scenarios with ease and conduct flexible experiments on their algorithms. This feature significantly streamlines the development process, making it more efficient and user-friendly. (2) Qsyn offers detailed access to multiple data representations at different abstraction levels of quantum circuits. This capability allows developers to optimize their algorithms extensively, gaining deeper insights and control over the structure and behavior of quantum circuits. By understanding the intricacies of circuit design, developers can achieve higher levels of optimization and performance in their algorithms. (3) Qsyn implements a rigorous development flow and environment to help developers maintain high-quality standards using modern software engineering practices, including robust quality assurance measures like regression testing, continuous integration and continuous delivery (Cl/CD) pipelines, and code Tinting. We demonstrate Qsyn's superior performance through fair comparisons with PyZX In highlighting its efficiency and optimization capabilities.

The area of testing in quantum systems has received greater attention in research on this topic to guarantee the quality and reliability of these technologies. Objective: This paper presents an empirical study focused on the testing of quantum software at its classical layer. Specifically, it aims to identify and analyze the unique characteristics of quantum software tests, particularly in terms of Test Smells, their distribution, recurrence, and differences compared to classical software tests. Method: We used two sets of software from previous studies, one comprising 12 quantum software and the other comprising 80 classical software. From these datasets, we conducted an analysis to detect 10 test smells, allowing us to map their dispersion in quantum software, identify their specific characteristics, and draw comparisons with classical software. Results: Our findings reveal a high dispersion of test smells of 51% in quantum software. Furthermore, quantum tests exhibit statistical differences from classical software tests, with the most outlier being Conditional Test Logic, which is 20% more frequent than in classical software. Conclusions: The insights gained from this study can contribute to enhancing the quality, maintainability, and readability of tests written for the classical layer of quantum software. Ultimately, this can improve the overall understanding and quality of quantum software.},

 abstract = {As a new research area, quantum software testing lacks systematic testing benchmarks to assess testing techniques' effectiveness. Recently, some open-source benchmarks and mutation analysis tools have emerged. However, there is insufficient evidence on how various quantum circuit characteristics (e.g., circuit depth, number of quantum gates), algorithms (e.g., Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm), and mutation characteristics (e.g., mutation operators) affect the detection of mutants in quantum circuits. Studying such relations is important to systematically design faulty benchmarks with varied attributes (e.g., the difficulty in detecting a seeded fault) to facilitate assessing the cost-effectiveness of quantum software testing techniques efficiently. To this end, we present a large-scale empirical evaluation with more than 700K faulty benchmarks (quantum circuits) generated by mutating 382 real-world quantum circuits. Based on the results, we provide valuable insights for researchers to define systematic quantum mutation analysis techniques. We also provide a tool to recommend mutants to users based on chosen characteristics (e.g., a quantum algorithm type) and the required difficulty of detecting mutants. Finally, we also provide faulty benchmarks that can already be used to assess the cost-effectiveness of quantum software testing techniques.},

Recently, quantum computing has re-emerged as a promising technology to solve problems that a classical computer could take hundreds of years to solve.

This article presents a roadmap for addressing these challenges, pointing out the existing gaps in the literature and suggesting research directions. We discuss the limitations caused by noise, the no-cloning theorem, the lack of a standard architecture for quantum computers, among others. Regarding testing, we highlight gaps and opportunities related to transpilation, mutation analysis, input states with hybrid interfaces, program analysis, and coverage. For debugging, we present the current strategies, including classical techniques applied to quantum programs, quantum-specific assertions, and quantum-related bug patterns. We introduce a conceptual model to illustrate concepts regarding the testing and debugging of quantum programs and the relationship between them. Those concepts are used to identify and discuss research challenges to cope with quantum programs through 2030, focusing on the interfaces between classical and quantum computing and on creating testing and debugging techniques that take advantage of the unique quantum computing characteristics.},

This paper presents an empirical study of testing patterns in quantum algorithms. We analyzed all the tests handling quantum aspects of the implementations in the Qiskit Algorithms library and identified seven distinct patterns that make use of (1) fixed seeds for algorithms based on random elements; (2) deterministic oracles; (3) precise and approximate assertions; (4) Data-Driven Testing (DDT); (5) functional testing; (6) testing for intermediate parts of the algorithms being tested; and (7) equivalence checking for quantum circuits.
