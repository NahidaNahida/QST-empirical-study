  abstract={Quantum software testing (QST) is an emerging research area within quantum software engineering (QSE) to ensure quantum software functional and non-functional correctness and dependabil-ity. Since quantum computers perform computations significantly differently than classical computing, testing quantum software run-ning on these quantum computers also differs due to quantum computing's unique characteristics, e.g., entanglement and super-position. Due to the rising interest of the software engineering community in QSE, we will provide an introduction to QST. We will introduce quantum computing and its various principles, quan-tum software development as quantum circuits, and current QST literature, including a key set of techniques with examples. Finally, a set of future research challenges related to QST will be presented.},

  abstract={As quantum computing is still in its infancy, there is an inherent lack of knowledge and technology to test a quantum program properly. In the classical realm, mutation testing has been successfully used to evaluate how well a program's test suite detects seeded faults (i.e., mutants). In this article, building on the definition of syntactically equivalent quantum operations, we propose a novel set of mutation operators to generate mutants based on qubit measurements and quantum gates. To ease the adoption of quantum mutation testing, we further propose QMutPy, an extension of the well-known and fully automated open-source mutation tool MutPy. To evaluate QMutPy's performance, we conducted a case study on 24 real quantum programs written in IBM's Qiskit library. Furthermore, we show how better test suite coverage and improvements to test assertions can increase the test suites' mutation score and quality. QMutPy has proven to be an effective quantum mutation tool, providing insight into the current state of quantum tests and how to improve them.},

  abstract={Although classical computing has excelled in a wide range of applications, there remain problems that push the limits of its capabilities, especially in fields like cryptography, optimization, and materials science. Quantum computing introduces a new computational paradigm, based on principles of superposition and entanglement to explore solutions beyond the capabilities of classical computation. With the increasing interest in the field, there are challenges and opportunities for academics and practitioners in terms of software engineering practices, particularly in testing quantum programs. This paper presents an empirical study of testing patterns in quantum algorithms. We analyzed all the tests handling quantum aspects of the implementations in the Qiskit Algorithms library and identified seven distinct patterns that make use of (1) fixed seeds for algorithms based on random elements; (2) deterministic oracles; (3) precise and approximate assertions; (4) Data-Driven Testing (DDT); (5) functional testing; (6) testing for intermediate parts of the algorithms being tested; and (7) equivalence checking for quantum circuits. Our results show a prevalence of classical testing techniques to test the quantum-related elements of the library, while recent advances from the research community have yet to achieve wide adoption among practitioners.},

  abstract={Cause-effect graphs have shown promising results in identifying relations among causes and effects of classical software systems, followed by designing effective test cases from them. Towards this end, we investigate the use of cause-effect graphs for quantum pro-grams. Classical cause-effect graphs apply classical logic (e.g., AND, OR) to express these relations, which might not be practical for describing similar relations in quantum programs due to quantum superposition and entanglement. Thus, we propose an extension of cause-effect graphs, where quantum logic inspired functions (e.g., Hadamard) and their generalizations are defined and applied. Moreover, we present a metamodel describing various forms of cause-effect graphs. Finally, we demonstrate a possible method for generating test cases from a quantum cause-effect graph applied to a Bell state quantum program. Lastly, the design and utility of the resulting testing method is discussed, along with future prospects for general quantum cause-effect graphs.},

  abstract={In recent years, software engineers have explored ways to assist quantum software programmers. Our goal in this paper is to continue this exploration and see if quantum software programmers deal with some problems plaguing classical programs. Specifically, we examine whether intermittently failing tests, i.e., flaky tests, affect quantum software development. To explore flakiness, we conduct a preliminary analysis of 14 quantum software repositories. Then, we identify flaky tests and categorize their causes and methods of fixing them. We find flaky tests in 12 out of 14 quantum software repositories. In these 12 repositories, the lower boundary of the percentage of issues related to flaky tests ranges between 0.26% and 1.85% per repository. We identify 46 distinct flaky test reports with 8 groups of causes and 7 common solutions. Further, we notice that quantum programmers are not using some of the recent flaky test countermeasures developed by software engineers. This work may interest practitioners, as it provides useful insight into the resolution of flaky tests in quantum programs. Researchers may also find the paper helpful as it offers quantitative data on flaky tests in quantum software and points to new research opportunities.},

  abstract={Despite the increasing interest in quantum computing, the aspect of development to achieve cost-effective and reliable quantum software applications has been slow. One barrier is the software engineering of quantum programs, which can be approached from two directions. On the one hand, many software engineering practices, debugging in particular, are bound to classical computing. On the other hand, quantum programming is closely associated with the phenomena of quantum physics, and consequently, the way we express programs resembles the early days of programming. Moreover, much of the software engineering research today focuses on agile development, where computing cycles are cheap and new software can be rapidly deployed and tested, whereas in the quantum context, executions may consume lots of energy, and test runs may require lots of work to interpret. In this paper, we aim at bridging this gap by starting with the quantum computing workflow and by mapping existing software engineering research to this workflow. Based on the mapping, we then identify directions for software engineering research for quantum computing.},

  abstract={In this paper, we introduce Qsyn, a novel quantum circuit synthesis (QCS) framework designed to facilitate the research, development, testing, and experimentation of QCS algorithms and tools. Our framework is more developer-friendly than other modern QCS frameworks in three aspects: (1) Qsyn provides a comprehensive command-line interface that enables developers to design various testing scenarios with ease and conduct flexible experiments on their algorithms. This feature significantly streamlines the development process, making it more efficient and user-friendly. (2) Qsyn offers detailed access to multiple data representations at different abstraction levels of quantum circuits. This capability allows developers to optimize their algorithms extensively, gaining deeper insights and control over the structure and behavior of quantum circuits. By understanding the intricacies of circuit design, developers can achieve higher levels of optimization and performance in their algorithms. (3) Qsyn implements a rigorous development flow and environment to help developers maintain high-quality standards using modern software engineering practices, including robust quality assurance measures like regression testing, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and code linting. We demonstrate Qsyn's superior performance through fair comparisons with PyZX [1], highlighting its efficiency and optimization capabilities. By providing a unified and user-friendly development environment, Qsyn empowers researchers and developers to prototype, implement, and evaluate their QCS algorithms effectively.},

  abstract={The current quantum landscape is characterised by a wide variety of quantum computers, each with unique capabilities and limitations. Despite its rapid advancement, this field is still in its early stages and lacks essential software engineering principles such as resilience and customisability by design. To provide developers with a quantum technology stack that embeds these principles by design, we propose leveraging the heterogeneity of existing quantum computers. Specifically, we introduce a novel distribution methodology, termed shot-wise, to distribute the quantum computation workload of a single circuit execution (i.e., its shots) across multiple quantum computers. This shot-wise methodology is highly customisable, allowing for the em-bedding of user-specific and scenario-specific requirements into the distribution process. Requirements can be expressed through constraints, such as the geographical location of the QPUs, and their architecture, or ensuring or avoiding specific combinations of QPUs and quantum providers. Additionally, requirements can be defined by one or more objective functions to be minimised or maximised, such as reducing waiting time, computation cost, or energy footprint. By also combining constraints and objective functions, our shot-wise methodology enhances flexibility and improves the overall resilience of quantum computations against potential quantum computer failures. Preliminary results indicate that this approach offers error rates comparable to, or lower than, those of single-device execution even in all the tested scenarios with different numbers of qubits, families of circuits and number of QPUs to distribute the shots.},

We collect and investigate 96 real-world bugs and their fixes from four popular quantum programming languages (Qiskit, Cirq, Q#, and ProjectQ). Our study shows that a high proportion of bugs in quantum programs are quantum-specific bugs (over 80%), which requires further research in the bug fixing domain. We also summarize and extend the bug patterns in quantum programs and subdivide the most critical part, math-related bugs, to make it more applicable to the study of quantum programs. Our findings summarize the characteristics of bugs in quantum programs and provide a basis for studying testing and debugging quantum programs.},

  abstract={Quantum computing is expected to introduce the next era of computing speed and power, and its software - quantum program is gaining increasing research interest in the software engineering community. A significant characteristic of quantum computing is the existence of noise. Unlike classical computers where the output of a program is usually deterministic, the execution of a quantum program may be affected by quantum noise. Such a difference may cause difficulties or misunderstandings for developers shifting from classical programming to quantum programming. To understand the impact of quantum noise on quantum programs and its implications for software developers, we conduct a series of studies with real-world quantum programs and quantum computing environments. Specifically, we first measure and analyze the noise in a real quantum computer by testing it with a basic quantum program. We find that a non-neglectable amount of quantum noise generally exists in real quantum computers. Then we investigate the robustness of quantum programs against different quantum noises by testing 18 real-world quantum programs and 50,000 randomly generated quantum circuits in simulated and real environments. We observe that quantum noise can significantly influence the correctness of quantum programs, and different quantum circuit structures show diverse sensitivity patterns under the same noise. Based on the observations, we build a machine learning model to predict the fidelity of a quantum program under certain quantum noise. The model achieves a small average fidelity prediction error, meaning the impact of noise can be precisely estimated statistically.},

  abstract={The capability of Quantum Computing (QC) in solving complex problems has been increasingly recognized. However, similar to classical computing, to fully exploit QC's potential, it is important to ensure the correctness of quantum programs. Doing so via software testing is, however, very challenging because of QC's inherent properties: superposition and entanglement. Towards the direction of ensuring the correctness of quantum programs, we propose an approach called QuCAT (QUantum CombinAtorial Testing) for systematic and automated testing of quantum programs by benefiting from combinatorial testing, which has been proven to be cost-effective in testing classical programs. QuCAT supports two combinatorial test suite generation scenarios, i.e., generating combinatorial test suites of a given strength, and incrementally generating and executing combinatorial test suites of increasing strength until a fault is found. The approach employs two types of test oracles to assess test results. We performed an empirical study with 18 faulty versions of quantum programs to evaluate QuCAT with strengths of two, three, and four in the two test generation scenarios. We compare the cost-effectiveness of combinatorial testing of various strengths and random testing (taken as baseline approach). Results show that combinatorial testing always performs better than random testing with the same cost and finds faults more quickly (in terms of required number of test cases). In addition, in most cases, combinatorial testing with a higher strength outperforms the lower strength in terms of effectiveness.},

  abstract={Given that quantum software testing is a new area of research, there is a lack of benchmark programs and bugs repositories to assess the effectiveness of testing techniques. To this end, quantum mutation analysis focuses on systematically generating faulty versions of Quantum Programs (QPs), called mutants, using mutation operators. Such mutants can be used as benchmarks to assess the quality of test cases in a test suite. Thus, we present Muskit - a quantum mutation analysis tool for QPs coded in IBM's Qiskit language. Muskit defines mutation operators on gates of QPs and selection criteria to reduce the number of mutants to generate. Moreover, it allows for the execution of test cases on mutants and generation of results for test analyses. Muskit is provided as command line interface, GUI, and web application. We validated Muskit by using it to generate and execute mutants for four QPs.

  abstract={Quantum computers today are noisy and limited in the number of qubits that can be set with reasonable fidelities and gate times for each system. Since the current limit on the number of qubits is difficult to surpass, it is expected that the future of quantum computing will lie in connecting different quantum computers together to form a quantum network, each with its own limitations. Herein lies the field of distributed quantum computing optimized for large-scale communication. One such system that has been designed is the Quantum Message Passing Interface (QMPI). This interface, unlike the classical MPI, takes advantage of quantum teleportation to communicate between different quantum nodes but leverages the framework built for classical MPI. This general interface is essential as we try to connect various quantum computers, as it can be used to develop distributed quantum algorithms across various nodes. In this work, we develop a reference implementation for a QMPI interface in Qiskit and characterize its performance. In our interface, we have implemented point-to-point and optimized collective operations for larger distributed quantum networks. To test our framework, we demonstrate our implementation with applications that can leverage the QMPI framework including Trotterization of the transverse field Ising model and distributive quantum phase estimation. Lastly, we have developed a new technique for decomposing quantum gates across many nodes which leverages multi-controlled Toffolli gates. This technique beats the state of the art for an adder circuit in terms of fidelity and the number of EPR pairs used.},

  abstract={This article introduces a process framework for debugging quantum circuits, focusing on three distinct types of circuit blocks: amplitude–permutation, phase-modulation, and amplitude–redistribution circuit blocks. Our research addresses the critical need for specialized debugging approaches tailored to the unique properties of each circuit type. For amplitude–permutation circuits, we propose techniques to correct amplitude–permutations mimicking classical operations. In phase-modulation circuits, our proposed strategy targets the precise calibration of phase alterations essential for quantum computations. The most complex amplitude–redistribution circuits demand advanced methods to adjust probability amplitudes. This research bridges a vital gap in current methodologies and lays the groundwork for future advancements in quantum circuit debugging. Our contributions are twofold: we present a comprehensive unit testing tool (Cirquo) and debugging approaches tailored to the unique demands of quantum computing, and we provide empirical evidence of its effectiveness in optimizing quantum circuit performance. This work is a crucial step toward realizing robust quantum computing systems and their applications in various domains.},

  abstract={Practical quantum computing is rapidly becoming a reality. To harness quantum computers’ real potential in software applications, one needs to have an in-depth understanding of all such characteristics of quantum computing platforms (QCPs), relevant from the Software Engineering (SE) perspective. Restrictions on copying, deletion, the transmission of qubit states, a hard dependency on quantum algorithms are few, out of many, examples of QCP characteristics that have significant implications for building quantum software.Thus, developing quantum software requires a paradigm shift in thinking by software engineers. This paper presents the key findings from the SE perspective, resulting from an in-depth examination of state-of-the-art QCPs available today. The main contributions that we present include i) Proposing a general architecture of the QCPs, ii) Proposing a programming model for developing quantum software, iii) Determining architecturally significant characteristics of QCPs, and iv) Determining the impact of these characteristics on various Quality Attributes (QAs) and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) activities.We show that the nature of QCPs makes them useful mainly in specialized application areas such as scientific computing. Except for performance and scalability, most of the other QAs (e.g., maintainability, testability, and reliability) are adversely affected by different characteristics of a QCP.},

  abstract={As the scientific community is increasing the coverage of the quantum computing domain ranging from theoretical physics to financial applications, so does the number of quantum computing applications being developed for quantum computing hardware that is available today. As this hardware evolves towards increased capacity in terms of qubit number and increased fidelity, so does the complexity of quantum computing applications that implement the state-of-the-art of (hybrid) quantum algorithms. With this comes an increased demand for quantum software engineering practices where testing is a crucial part of the development process. Hence, a robust approach that addresses certain challenges and peculiarities related to the quantum computing domain is needed for the testing process.

  abstract={The most promising applications of quantum computing are centered around solving search and optimization tasks, particularly in fields such as physics simulations, quantum chemistry, and finance. However, the current quantum software testing methods face practical limitations when applied in industrial contexts: (i) they do not apply to quantum programs most relevant to the industry, (ii) they require a full program specification, which is usually not available for these programs, and (iii) they are incompatible with error mitigation methods currently adopted by main industry actors like IBM. To address these challenges, we present QOPS, a novel quantum software testing approach. QOPS introduces a new definition of test cases based on Pauli strings to improve compatibility with different quantum programs. QOPS also introduces a new test oracle that can be directly integrated with industrial APIs such as IBM’s Estimator API and can utilize error mitigation methods for testing on real noisy quantum computers. We also leverage the commuting property of Pauli strings to relax the requirement of having complete program specifications, making QOPS practical for testing complex quantum programs in industrial settings. We empirically evaluate QOPS on 194,982 real quantum programs, demonstrating effective performance in test assessment compared to the state-of-the-art with a perfect F1-score, precision, and recall. Furthermore, we validate the industrial applicability of QOPS by assessing its performance on IBM’s three real quantum computers, incorporating both industrial and open-source error mitigation methods.CCS Concepts• Software and its engineering → Correctness; • Theory of computation → Quantum computation theory; • Computer systems organization → Quantum computing},

  abstract={Quantum computing has been rapidly expanding, and many platforms for writing programs that can be compiled and run on quantum hardware (or simulated) are being developed. As with any compiler, transformation correctness is paramount as the machine readable code must maintain program semantics. Quantum programs are challenging to test given a lack of benchmark programs and the difficulty of defining an oracle. MorphQ solves both of these challenges by (1) generating syntactically correct quantum programs and (2) using metamorphic testing to avoid the oracle problem. However, Qiskit, the compiler it was built for, is rapidly evolving. This paper is a reproducibility study of the MorphQ platform, which we call MorphQ++. We have updated the core MorphQ engine to work on a newer version of Qiskit and added new metamorphic transformations. We find that our overall results are similar: we find a portion of the original faults (which were not yet fixed) and the distributions of types are not very different. Our new transformations lead to several new faults, suggesting there is room to expand the core framework. Additionally, we note the lack of power of the metamorphic relations in this context and suggest the need for more sophisticated relations and/or oracle evaluations.CCS CONCEPTS• Software and its engineering → Software testing and debugging, • Hardware → Quantum technologies.},

To this end, we present the quantum software testing tool QuCAT for combinatorial testing of quantum programs. QuCAT provides two functionalities of use. With the first functionality, the tool generates a test suite of a given strength (e.g., pairwise). With the second functionality, it generates test suites with increasing strength until a failure is triggered or a maximum strength is reached. QuCAT uses two test oracles to check the correctness of test outputs. We assess the cost and effectiveness of QuCAT with 3 faulty versions of 5 quantum programs. Results show that combinatorial test suites with a low strength can find faults with limited cost, while a higher strength performs better to trigger some difficult faults with relatively higher cost.},

  title={Mitigating Noise in Quantum Software Testing Using Machine Learning}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={50},
  number={11},
  pages={2947-2961},
  abstract={Quantum Computing (QC) promises computational speedup over classic computing. However, noise exists in near-term quantum computers. Quantum software testing (for gaining confidence in quantum software's correctness) is inevitably impacted by noise, i.e., it is impossible to know if a test case failed due to noise or real faults. Existing testing techniques test quantum programs without considering noise, i.e., by executing tests on ideal quantum computer simulators. Consequently, they are not directly applicable to test quantum software on real quantum computers or noisy simulators. Thus, we propose a noise-aware approach (named $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN) to alleviate the noise effect on test results of quantum programs. $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN employs machine learning techniques (e.g., transfer learning) to learn the noise effect of a quantum computer and filter it from a program's outputs. Such filtered outputs are then used as the input to perform test case assessments (determining the passing or failing of a test case execution against a test oracle). We evaluated $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN on IBM's 23 noise models, Google's two available noise models, and Rigetti's Quantum Virtual Machine, with six real-world and 800 artificial programs. We also generated faulty versions of these programs to check if a failing test case execution can be determined under noise. Results show that $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN can reduce the noise effect by more than $80\%$80% on most noise models. We used an existing test oracle to evaluate $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN's effectiveness in quantum software testing. The results showed that $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN attained scores of $99\%$99%, $75\%$75%, and $86\%$86% for precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively, for the test oracle across six real-world programs. For artificial programs, $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN achieved scores of $93\%$93%, $79\%$79%, and $86\%$86% for precision, recall, and F1-score respectively. This highlights $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN's effectiveness in learning noise patterns for noise-aware quantum software testing.},

  abstract={With recent breakthroughs in quantum computing, it has become a coming reality instead of a promising future. Quantum computing applications offer revolutionary potential across multiple domains including artificial intelligence (AI), optimization, healthcare, energy, and space, known as quantum advantage. The power of quantum computing relies on novel quantum algorithms, quantum software, and hardware. Unlike classical software, quantum software has unique features because of quantum mechanics such as superposition and noncloning. This opens a new research field - quantum software engineering (QSE). While the software engineering (SE) research community became aware of this need in 2019, we noticed the lack of a comprehensive investigation of state-of-the-art technologies and tools to improve quantum software quality. Testing and debugging are the two most efficient approaches to assure software quality in classical SE. In QSE, testing and debugging quantum programs become challenging due to quantum mechanics. While we can leverage some best practices from the classical world, new techniques and tools are needed to address the concerns in QSE. In this chapter, we first conduct a survey study of the state-of-the-art technologies and tools for testing and debugging quantum software. This study includes but is not limited to quantum bug pattern analysis and detection, quantum software testing techniques and classification, and quantum debugging techniques. In the second place, we provide our visions and insights of testing and debugging quantum software in terms of challenges and opportunities for improving quantum software quality. This survey has the potential to foster a research community committed to developing novel methods and tools for QSE.},

While the preliminary evidences of its prac-tical interest accumulate, there are numerous challenges that must be addressed before quantum computing can reach generalized adoption and realize its full potential. One such challenge concerns assessing whether a quantum program is correct, namely in the sense that it implements the desired functionality. In the classical realm, program testing is a well-established approach to find de-fects in programs. While this approach should inspire quantum software development, porting classical testing techniques to the quantum world is by no means trivial. We propose a novel approach to test quantum programs. Our approach is based on the use of metamorphic relations, which allows us to overcome the well-known quantum measurement problem. We describe a series of exploratory experiments whose results provide evidence of the usefulness of our approach.},

  abstract={Duke ARTIQ Extensions (DAX) provides a framework for writing modular control software for ion-trap quantum systems. DAX allows users to interface with the system at the gate level using an intermediate representation called DAX.program. However, DAX does not have the tools needed to simulate these programs to see quantum state evolutions, as DAX only allows for simulations at the device level. We propose a modular simulation framework, DAX.program-sim (DPS), that can simulate quantum programs at the level of quantum operations. This addition to DAX for classical simulation of quantum systems is vital for testing, benchmarking, and verification of quantum hardware. The DPS pipeline is designed to have input identical to the one that runs on the hardware. Our architecture allows flexible backends for simulation, enabling both gate-level simulations and pulse-level simulations with and without noise. We demonstrate this unified workflow, executing the same DAX.program file in simulation as well as on hardware. As a specific example, we run benchmarking circuits using simulators targeting ion trap quantum computers and compare them to hardware results of the same circuits.},

  abstract={Test case optimization (TCO) reduces the software testing cost while preserving its effectiveness. However, to solve TCO problems for large-scale and complex software systems, substantial computational resources are required. Quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOAs) are promising combinatorial optimization algorithms that rely on quantum computational resources, with the potential to offer increased efficiency compared to classical approaches. Several proof-of-concept applications of QAOAs for solving combinatorial problems, such as portfolio optimization, energy optimization in power systems, and job scheduling, have been proposed. Given the lack of investigation into QAOA's application for TCO problems, and motivated by the computational challenges of TCO problems and the potential of QAOAs, we present IGDec-QAOA to formulate a TCO problem as a QAOA problem and solve it on both ideal and noisy quantum computer simulators, as well as on a real quantum computer. To solve bigger TCO problems that require many qubits, which are unavailable these days, we integrate a problem decomposition strategy with the QAOA. We performed an empirical evaluation with five TCO problems and four publicly available industrial datasets from ABB, Google, and Orona to compare various configurations of IGDec-QAOA, assess its decomposition strategy of handling large datasets, and compare its performance with classical algorithms (i.e., Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Random Search). Based on the evaluation results achieved on an ideal simulator, we recommend the best configuration of our approach for TCO problems. Also, we demonstrate that our approach can reach the same effectiveness as GA and outperform GA in two out of five test case optimization problems we conducted. In addition, we observe that, on the noisy simulator, IGDec-QAOA achieved similar performance to that from the ideal simulator. Finally, we also demonstrate the feasibility of IGDec-QAOA on a real quantum computer in the presence of noise.},

This shift has given rise to the field of quantum software engineering (QSE), focused on developing novel approaches for engineering large-scale quantum applications. Traditional software engineering methods fall short in addressing the unique characteristics of quantum computing, necessitating innovative QSE methodologies and tools. While progress has been made in testing and debugging quantum programs, very little work has been done on analyzing if and how existing requirements engineering techniques can address the challenges that designing quantum software raises.

  abstract={This article proposes an efficient quantum train engine (EQuaTE), a novel development tool for quantum neural network (QNN) autonomous driving software, which plots gradient variances to confirm whether the QNN falls into local minima situations (called barren plateaus). Based on this runtime visualization, the stability and feasibility of QNN-based software can be tested during runtime operations of autonomous driving functionalities. This software testing of a QNN via dynamic analysis is essentially required due to undetermined probabilistic qubit states during runtime operations. Furthermore, an EQuaTE is capable of visual feedback because the barren plateaus can be identified at local autonomous driving platforms, and the corresponding information will be visualized at remotely connected cloud. Based on this visualized information at the cloud, the QNN, which is also stored at cloud, should be automatically reorganized and retrained for eliminating barren plateaus. Then, the trained parameters can be downloaded into the QNN of autonomous driving platforms.},

  abstract={This position paper examines the substantial divide between academia and industry within quantum software engineering. For example, while academic research related to debugging and testing predominantly focuses on a limited subset of primarily quantum-specific issues, industry practitioners face a broader range of practical concerns, including software integration, compatibility, and real-world implementation hurdles. This disconnect mainly arises due to academia's limited access to industry practices and the often confidential, competitive nature of quantum development in commercial settings. As a result, academic advancements often fail to translate into actionable tools and methodologies that meet industry needs. By analyzing discussions within quantum developer forums, we identify key gaps in focus and resource availability that hinder progress on both sides. We propose collaborative efforts aimed at developing practical tools, methodologies, and best practices to bridge this divide, enabling academia to address the application-driven needs of industry and fostering a more aligned, sustainable ecosystem for quantum software development.},

  year={2024},

  pages={1-12},
  abstract={Quantum Computing (QC) leverages quantum mechanics to manipulate quantum information, holding greater potential than classical computing. To fully exploit QC’s potential, it is crucial to ensure the reliability and quality of quantum programs. Research on quantum program testing is still at its early stage, in which some distinctive features of quantum programs, e.g., superposition and entanglement, may be overlooked, and the fault detection capability and testing effectiveness are rather limited. Besides, the input space of quantum programs may exponentially grow when the number of qubits increases, posing great challenges to testing quantum programs. It is imperative to develop a proper testing strategy to effectively select the potential failure-causing test cases and detect faults faster. In this paper, test cases with both basis states and superposition ones are considered and generated to cover more input space. A hybrid distance measurement method based on quantum fidelity and Hamming distance is presented for measuring the similarity among quantum test cases. Furthermore, a Dynamic Random Testing strategy based on Hybrid distance metrics (DRT-H) for quantum programs is proposed, which combines the hybrid distance metrics and the feedback mechanism of the classical Dynamic Random Testing (DRT) strategy to adjust the testing profile and guide the test case selection. Experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed DRT-H strategy outperforms the baseline testing strategies in most cases.},

  abstract={The recent fast development of quantum computers breaks several computation limitations that are difficult for conventional computers. Up to the present, although many approaches and tools have been proposed to test quantum programs, the fundamental features of quantum programs, i.e., magnitude, phase, and entanglement, have been largely overlooked, leading to limited fault detection capability and reduced testing effectiveness. To address this problem, we propose an automated testing framework named QURATEST, equipped with three test case generators (including two newly proposed techniques, UCNOT and IQFT in this paper, as well as one based on Random techniques) to test quantum programs. Overall, the proposed generators enable the generation of diverse test inputs by considering the quantum features of quantum programs. In the experiments, we perform an in-depth evaluation of QURATEST from three aspects: generated test case diversity, output coverage of the program under test, and fault detection capability. The results demonstrate the potential of our newly proposed techniques in that IQFT can generate the most diverse test cases regarding magnitude, phase, and entanglement, with 66% cell coverage. Comparatively, the Random approach only has 10% cell coverage. Regarding the evaluations of the output coverage, IQFT can achieve the highest output coverage in 70.2% (33 out of 47) of all quantum programs. In terms of fault detection, UCNOT outperforms the other two techniques. Specifically, the test cases generated by UCNOT have the best mutation score in 88.4% (23 out of 26) quantum programs.},

  abstract={As the scale of quantum programs grows to match that of classical software, the nascent field of quantum software engineering must mature and tools such as debuggers will become increasingly important. However, developing a quantum debugger is challenging due to the nature of a quantum computer; sneaking a peek at the value of a quantum state will cause either partial or complete collapse of the superposition and may destroy the necessary entanglement. As a first step to developing a full quantum circuit debugger, we have designed and implemented a quantum circuit debugging tool. The tool allows the user to divide the circuit vertically or horizontally into smaller chunks known as slices, and manage their simulation or execution for either interactive debugging or automated testing. The tool also enables developers to track gates within the overall circuit and each chunk to understand their behavior better. Feedback on usefulness and usability from early users shows that using the tool to slice and test their circuits has helped make the debugging process more time-efficient for them.},

  abstract={Recent advancements in quantum computing software are gradually increasing the scope and size of quantum programs being developed. At the same time, however, these larger programs provide more possibilities for functional errors that are harder to detect and resolve. Meanwhile, debugging tools that could aid developers in resolving these errors are still barely existent and far from what we take for granted in classical design automation and software engineering. As a result, even if one manages to identify the incorrect behavior of a developed quantum program, detecting and resolving the underlying errors in the program remains a time-consuming and tedious task. Moreover, the exponential growth of the state space in quantum programs makes the efficient manual investigation of errors radically difficult even for respectively simple algorithms, and almost impossible as the number of qubits increases. To address this problem, this work proposes a debugging framework, available as an open-source implementation at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-debugger. It assists developers in debugging errors in quantum programs, allowing them to efficiently identify the existence of errors and diagnose their causes. Users are given the ability to place assertions in the code that test for the correctness of a given algorithm and are evaluated using classical simulations of the underlying quantum program. Once an assertion fails, the proposed framework employs different diagnostic methods to point towards possible error causes. This way, the debugging workload for quantum programs is drastically reduced.},

  abstract={As quantum computing is becoming increasingly popular, the underlying quantum computing platforms are growing both in ability and complexity. Unfortunately, testing these platforms is challenging due to the relatively small number of existing quantum programs and because of the oracle problem, i.e., a lack of specifications of the expected behavior of programs. This paper presents MorphQ, the first metamorphic testing approach for quantum computing platforms. Our two key contributions are (i) a program generator that creates a large and diverse set of valid (i.e., non-crashing) quantum programs, and (ii) a set of program transformations that exploit quantum-specific metamorphic relationships to alleviate the oracle problem. Evaluating the approach by testing the popular Qiskit platform shows that the approach creates over 8k program pairs within two days, many of which expose crashes. Inspecting the crashes, we find 13 bugs, nine of which have already been confirmed. MorphQ widens the slim portfolio of testing techniques of quantum computing platforms, helping to create a reliable software stack for this increasingly important field.},

  abstract={When a bug is detected by testing a quantum program on a quantum computer, we want to determine its location to fix it. To locate the bug, the quantum program is divided into several segments, and each segment is tested. However, to prepare a quantum state that is input to a segment, it is necessary to execute all the segments ahead of that segment in a quantum computer. This means that the cost of testing each segment depends on its location. We can also locate a buggy segment only if it is confirmed that there are no bugs in all segments ahead of that buggy segment. Since a quantum program is tested statistically on the basis of measurement results, there is a tradeoff between testing accuracy and cost. Although these characteristics are unique to quantum programs and complicate locating bugs, they have not been investigated. We suggest for the first time that these characteristics should be considered to efficiently locate bugs. We are also the first to propose a bug-locating method that takes these characteristics into account. The results from experiments indicate that the bug-locating cost, represented as the number of executed quantum gates, can be reduced with the proposed method compared with naive methods.},

  abstract={As quantum information processors grow in quantum bit (qubit) count and functionality, the control and measurement system becomes a limiting factor to large-scale extensibility. To tackle this challenge and keep pace with rapidly evolving classical control requirements, full control stack access is essential to system-level optimization. We design a modular field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based system called QubiC to control and measure a superconducting quantum processing unit. The system includes room temperature electronics hardware, FPGA gateware, and engineering software. A prototype hardware module is assembled from several commercial off-the-shelf evaluation boards and in-house-developed circuit boards. Gateware and software are designed to implement basic qubit control and measurement protocols. System functionality and performance are demonstrated by performing qubit chip characterization, gate optimization, and randomized benchmarking sequences on a superconducting quantum processor operating at the Advanced Quantum Testbed at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The single-qubit and two-qubit process fidelities are measured to be 0.9980 $\pm$ 0.0001 and 0.948 $\pm$ 0.004, respectively, by randomized benchmarking. With fast circuit sequence loading capability, the QubiC performs randomized compiling experiments efficiently and improves the feasibility of executing more complex algorithms.},

However, the current approaches to quantum computing often require a deep understanding of quantum hardware and low-level programming languages, making it difficult for software developers to create and deploy quantum services. This paper argues for the adaptation of Service-Oriented Computing principles to quantum computing, enabling a level of abstraction from hardware that allows developers to focus on application development. This will allow developers to create and deploy quantum services, similarly to how Service-Oriented Computing has made it easier to develop traditional software services. This paper presents a Continuous Deployment approach for quantum service development, which involves the generation and deployment of quantum services. To do that, we propose an extension of the OpenAPI specification to generate services implementing a quantum algorithm. To validate the feasibility of the proposed process, we use a variety of quantum algorithm implementations to test their generation and deployment of quantum services.},

  pages={4949-4958},
  abstract={To overcome the issue of traditional blind signature schemes being vulnerable to quantum computing attacks during interactions over the consumer electronic Internet of Things (CIoT), a new blind signature scheme called CDBS has been developed. The post quantum digital signature technique CRYSTALS-Dilithium, which was standardized by NIST, serves as the foundation for the quantum-resistant blind signature scheme, CDBS, presented in this study. This system is appropriate for a variety of Internet application scenarios, including e-ticketing, anonymous payments, and privacy protection, because it integrates the idea of blind signatures, which is not included in typical digital signature schemes. This scheme is designed to resist quantum computing attacks and is based on the post-quantum digital signature algorithm CRYSTALS-Dilithium, which NIST has selected. The whole technique utilizes the Fiat-Shamir signature structure, which consists of five stages: key creation, blinding, signing, unblinding, and verification. The security of the proposed scheme is dependent on the resolution of the Module Learning with Errors (MLWE) problem and the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem. Additionally, the scheme must satisfy the criteria of correctness, blindness, and unforgeability. According to the test results, the CRYSTALS-Dilithium scheme requires an average of  $401.89~\mu $  s for a single round of verification and signing. The CDBS technique takes an average of  $657.65~\mu $  s for one round of signing and verification since the blinding and unblinding modules are added on top of the original algorithm, increasing the algorithm’s complexity. The software testing results indicate that the average time required to complete a single full blind signature and verification operation is 657.65 microseconds. The suggested system offers a framework for expanding the CRYSTALS-Dilithium digital signature algorithm.},

  abstract={A software product line models the variability of highly configurable systems. Complete exploration of all valid configurations (the configuration space) is infeasible as it grows exponentially with the number of features in the worst case. In practice, few representative configurations are sampled instead, which may be used for software testing or hardware verification. Pseudo-randomness of modern computers introduces statistical bias into these samples. Quantum computing enables truly random, uniform configuration sampling based on inherently random quantum physical effects. We propose a method to encode the entire configuration space in a superposition and then measure one random sample. We show the method's uniformity over multiple samples and investigate its scale for different feature models. We discuss the possibilities and limitations of quantum computing for uniform random sampling regarding current and future quantum hardware.},

  abstract={Fuzzing has achieved tremendous success in discovering bugs and vulnerabilities in various software systems. Systems under test (SUTs) that take in programming or formal language as inputs, e.g., compilers, runtime engines, constraint solvers, and software libraries with accessible APIs, are especially important as they are fundamental building blocks of software development. However, existing fuzzers for such systems often target a specific language, and thus cannot be easily applied to other languages or even other versions of the same language. Moreover, the inputs generated by existing fuzzers are often limited to specific features of the input language, and thus can hardly reveal bugs related to other or new features. This paper presents Fuzz4ALL, the first fuzzer that is universal in the sense that it can target many different input languages and many different features of these languages. The key idea behind Fuzz4ALL is to leverage large language models (LLMs) as an input generation and mutation engine, which enables the approach to produce diverse and realistic inputs for any practically relevant language. To realize this potential, we present a novel autoprompting technique, which creates LLM prompts that are well- suited for fuzzing, and a novel LLM-powered fuzzing loop, which iteratively updates the prompt to create new fuzzing inputs. We evaluate Fuzz4ALL on nine systems under test that take in six different languages (C, C++, Go, SMT2, Java, and Python) as inputs. The evaluation shows, across all six languages, that universal fuzzing achieves higher coverage than existing, language-specific fuzzers. Furthermore, Fuzz4ALL has identified 98 bugs in widely used systems, such as GCC, Clang, Z3, CVC5, OpenJDK, and the Qiskit quantum computing platform, with 64 bugs already confirmed by developers as previously unknown.},

  abstract={The ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) celebrated its 50th year in May 2025, and while I was there, I was fortunate to listen to Michael Hilton (Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), who suggested that, currently, the uncertainty of flaky tests was like the uncertainty of quantum computers. How should we handle this uncertainty or nondeterminism? Flaky tests are tests that give different results when executing the test suite, though the software has not changed. The comparison might not be exactly right, but it has a degree of similarity. Quantum can only solve quantum-framed problems, and not NP-complete problems (i.e., the hardest problems to be verified quickly). On the other hand, there are many published works examining flaky tests in quantum,1,2 as there is uncertainty in the results, even if the causes are rather different.},
