abstract = {Abstract In the past decade, quantum computing has undergone rapid evolution, capturing the increasing interest of the scientific community, industry, and governments. This enthusiasm has resulted in ambitious growth plans which stimulate the development of more efficient quantum computing devices and programming environments. The easy accessibility of quantum platforms in the cloud has attracted individuals to explore quantum computing, prompting a comprehensive analysis and assessment of quantum device's behavior. The extensive benchmarking presented in this study involved all free available quantum computing devices within the IBM Quantum Platform. These devices are employed to execute tens of thousands of quantum program executions, with the objective of evaluating quantum computer behavior and performance over time and under different optimization options. Special emphasis has been placed on analyzing the transpile operation and the depth of generated quantum circuits. The machine analysis tests are conducted using Quantum Computing Run Assistant (QCRA), a versatile software tool specifically designed to streamline the effortless distribution of quantum programs across a range of quantum computing platforms. This software not only streamlines the optimization of benchmarking processes but also simplifies the assessment of different configurations and result quality through the collection of advanced job metadata.},

abstract = {Abstract Quantum chemistry (QC) is one of the most promising applications of quantum computing. However, present quantum processing units (QPUs) are still subject to large errors. Therefore, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware is limited in terms of qubit counts/circuit depths. Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithms can potentially overcome such issues. Here, we introduce the OpenVQE open-source QC package. It provides tools for using and developing chemically-inspired adaptive methods derived from unitary coupled cluster (UCC). It facilitates the development and testing of VQE algorithms and is able to use the Atos Quantum Learning Machine (QLM), a general quantum programming framework enabling to write/optimize/simulate quantum computing programs. We present a specific, freely available QLM open-source module, myQLM-fermion. We review its key tools for facilitating QC computations (fermionic second quantization, fermion-spin transforms, etc.). OpenVQE largely extends the QLM's QC capabilities by providing: (i) the functions to generate the different types of excitations beyond the commonly used UCCSD ansatz; (ii) a new Python implementation of the “adaptive derivative assembled pseudo-Trotter method” (ADAPT-VQE). Interoperability with other major quantum programming frameworks is ensured thanks to the myQLM-interop package, which allows users to build their own code and easily execute it on existing QPUs. The combined OpenVQE/myQLM-fermion libraries facilitate the implementation, testing and development of variational quantum algorithms, while offering access to large molecules as the noiseless Schrödinger-style dense simulator can reach up to 41 qubits for any circuit. Extensive benchmarks are provided for molecules associated to qubit counts ranging from 4 to 24. We focus on reaching chemical accuracy, reducing the number of circuit gates and optimizing parameters and operators between “fixed-length” UCC and ADAPT-VQE ansätze.

It has an impact yet to explore on all software lifecycle's processes and techniques. Testing quantum software raises a significant number of challenges due to the unique properties of quantum physics—such as superposition and entanglementand the stochastic behavior of quantum systems. It is, therefore, an open research issue. In this work, we offer a systematic mapping study of quantum software testing engineering, presenting a comprehensive view of the current state of the art. The main identified trends in testing techniques are (1) the statistic approaches based on repeated measurements and (2) the use of Hoare-like logics to reason about software correctness. Another relevant line of research is reversible circuit testing, which is partially applicable to quantum software unitary testing. Finally, we have observed a flourishing of secondary studies and frameworks supporting testing processes from 2018 onwards.},

abstract = {Abstract Powerful hardware services and software libraries are vital tools for quickly and affordably designing, testing, and executing quantum algorithms. A robust large-scale study of how the performance of these platforms scales with the number of qubits is key to providing quantum solutions to challenging industry problems. This work benchmarks the runtime and accuracy for a representative sample of specialized high-performance simulated and physical quantum processing units. Results show the QMware simulator can reduce the runtime for executing a quantum circuit by up to 78\% compared to the next fastest option for algorithms with fewer than 27 qubits. The Amazon Web Service State-Vector Simulator 1 offers a runtime advantage for larger circuits, up to the maximum 34 qubits. Beyond this limit, QMware can execute circuits as large as 40 qubits. Physical quantum devices, such as Rigetti's Aspen-M2, can provide an exponential runtime advantage for circuits with more than 30 qubits. However, the high financial cost of physical quantum processing units presents a serious barrier to practical use. Moreover, only IonQ's Harmony quantum device achieves high fidelity with more than four qubits. This study paves the way to understanding the optimal combination of available software and hardware for executing practical quantum algorithms.},

abstract = {Abstract Quantum computing can potentially hack the information encrypted by traditional cryptographic systems, leading to the development of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to counteract this threat. The key principle behind PQC is the “learning with errors” problem, where intentional errors make encrypted information unpredictable. Intentional errors refer to Gaussian distributed data. However, implementing Gaussian distributed errors is challenging owing to computational and memory overhead. Therefore, this study proposes a Gaussian error sampler that employs the intrinsic Gaussian properties of nanometer-scale semiconductor devices. The proposed Gaussian error sampler significantly reduces computational and memory overhead. This work comprehensively evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed device by conducting statistical normality tests and generating quantile–quantile plots. The optimal programming voltage is identified to be −5.25 V, and the experimental results confirmed the Gaussian distribution of error data generated by the proposed module, aligning closely with software-generated Gaussian distributions and distinct from uniform random distributions.},

An image encryption scheme is proposed benefiting from chaotic random behavior characteristics of Boson sampling (BS) probability distribution, where the chaotic random number sequence is used to implement the encryption process including scrambling image pixels and altering the values of pixels. Further, a BS-based image encryption prototype system is constructed on the programmable silicon photonic processor chip for BS with 5-mode 2-photon, which can encrypt 4 × 4 grayscale images. Besides, experiments for encrypting 256 × 256 gray-scale images with 20-mode 8-photon BS are simulated on the StrawberryFields photonic quantum software platform. Numerical analyses demonstrate the proposed scheme has good effectiveness in terms of randomness test, information entropy, histogram, correlation, key space, key sensitivity, and anti-attack, offering gains in many cryptographic applications. The BS-based image encryption prototype system extends the application of BS to solve practical problems in addition to proving quantum advantages.},

Other QM packages will be added in future releases. The main advantage of gmx2qmmm is its simplicity in terms of input setup and configuration as it maintains the Gromacs file formats, as well as input conventions. It is also designed such that users do not need to reconfigure or recompile any of the interfaced programs. While our main goal was to provide a simplified transition from Gromacs to QM/MM using Gromacs directly as the basis for the MM part, we considered alternative ways to treat the QM/MM boundary. Our software was also developed to test a previously considered way to account for the presence of link atoms, which we term here link atom correction functions (LCFs). We show that LCFs can be good candidates to improve the forces at the QM/MM junction; however, from our data, it is also apparent that LCFs will not necessarily improve energy barriers, likely due to them being tailored to improve the situation close to potential minima. LCFs are, however, trivial to set up and can be used in the future to support the accuracy of QM/MM optimizations and dynamics. We present data on how our interface compares to a full QM description of small polypeptides; furthermore, we investigate the UV/vis spectroscopy of chlorophyll-containing proteins depending on the employed potentials and geometries.},

AQME workflows integrate tasks performed across multiple computational chemistry packages and data formats, preserving all computational protocols, data, and metadata for machine and human users to access and reuse. AQME has a modular structure of independent modules that can be implemented in any sequence, allowing the users to use all or only the desired parts of the program. The code has been developed for researchers with basic familiarity with the Python programming language. The CSEARCH module interfaces to molecular mechanics and semi-empirical QM (SQM) conformer generation tools (e.g., RDKit and Conformer–Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool, CREST) starting from various initial structure formats. The CMIN module enables geometry refinement with SQM and neural network potentials, such as ANI. The QPREP module interfaces with multiple QM programs, such as Gaussian, ORCA, and PySCF. The QCORR module processes QM results, storing structural, energetic, and property data while also enabling automated error handling (i.e., convergence errors, wrong number of imaginary frequencies, isomerization, etc.) and job resubmission. The QDESCP module provides easy access to QM ensemble-averaged molecular descriptors and computed properties, such as NMR spectra. Overall, AQME provides automated, transparent, and reproducible workflows to produce, analyze and archive computational chemistry results. SMILES inputs can be used, and many aspects of tedious human manipulation can be avoided. Installation and execution on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms have been tested, and the code has been developed to support access through Jupyter Notebooks, the command line, and job submission (e.g., Slurm) scripts. Examples of pre-configured workflows are available in various formats, and hands-on video tutorials illustrate their use.

The quantum convolutional layer is designed using a parameterized quantum circuit. It is used to perform linear unitary transformation on the quantum state to extract hidden information. In addition, the quantum pooling unit is used to perform pooling operations. After the evolution of the quantum system, we measure the quantum state and input the measurement results into a classical fully connected layer for further processing. We demonstrate its potential by applying HQCCNN to the MNIST dataset.

One of the biggest challenges in VQAs is designing quantum circuits tailored to the particular problem. This article proposes a gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) technique to automate the process of quantum circuit design. Our proposed technique introduces a novel formulation of the action space based on a sampling scheme and a progressive widening technique to explore the space dynamically. When testing our MCTS approach on the domain of random quantum circuits, MCTS approximates unstructured circuits under different values of stabilizer Rényi entropy. It turns out that MCTS manages to approximate the benchmark quantum states independently from their degree of nonstabilizerness. Next, our technique exhibits robustness across various application domains, including quantum chemistry and systems of linear equations. Compared to previous MCTS research, our technique reduces the number of quantum circuit evaluations by a factor of 10 up to 100 while achieving equal or better results. In addition, the resulting quantum circuits exhibit up to three times fewer two-qubit gates, which is important for implementation on noisy quantum hardware.}

However, constrained by a handful of qubits and noisy quantum gates available in the near-term quantum devices, hybrid quantum-classical algorithms based on variational methods such as variational quantum eigensolver have become a preferable choice. Here we propose an interesting variational quantum algorithm for obtaining the excited states of many-body Hamiltonians. To obtain the kth excited states, the previous variational quantum deflation algorithm requires the use of k different variational circuits, which is now reduced to only two circuits with our algorithm. The feasibility of the algorithm was numerically tested on the hydrogen molecule with and without random noise, where the chemical accuracy is reached for both cases. This algorithm is expected to significantly reduce the resource requirements of quantum simulation.},

This game is tested by preparing a 6-qubit cluster state using quantum computers on the cloud by IBM, IonQ, and Honeywell. The present implementation includes several levels of optimization, such as circuit identities and error mitigation, and allows us to cross the classical threshold and demonstrate quantum advantage in one quantum computer.

In the first model, the quantum circuit functionality is reduced to equivalent, arithmetic (multiply-and-accumulate) operations and combined with two computation methods, based on lookup and dynamic generation. In the second model, a kernel operation is extracted from the quantum circuit based on its functionality, and the kernel is iterated through all input quantum states. The proposed emulation models provide space and time optimizations, significantly reducing resource utilizations and latencies and improving scalability. We use these models to develop a highly scalable hardware emulator that is based on reconfigurable technology for efficient simulations of full quantum algorithms and circuits. Our hardware implementations support single precision floating point arithmetic for improved accuracy, and contain fully pipelined designs for high throughput. We investigate quantum algorithms such as quantum Fourier transform and quantum wavelet transform and explore different hardware architectures and optimizations. Experimental results and analysis are provided for the architectures in terms of resource consumption and emulation time. The experiments are carried out on a high-performance reconfigurable computing system and the obtained results show that the proposed emulator is feasible for running and testing a variety of quantum algorithms.},

abstract = {Abstract The discrete logarithm problem over a multiplicative group of integer modulo n is the key ingredient in the ElGamal encryption system. This problem has been proven to be tractable in polynomial time on a quantum computer by Shor's algorithm. This algorithm makes use of basic quantum gates, circuits, measurements and it has been experimented in the circuit-gate framework of quantum computing. On the other hand, the adiabatic framework of quantum computing with the quantum annealers such as the D-Wave machine that simulates the adiabatic process has become very popular, showing its potential for making a practical pathway to achieve quantum speedup. Furthermore, much progress has been reported recently on the tractability of the integer factoring problem, which is the other widely-used encryption method, on quantum annealers. In this context, it is important to explore the tractability of the discrete logarithm problem too using quantum annealers. In this work we present a first step made in this direction, by converting the discrete logarithm problem over a multiplicative group into the problem of minimizing a binary quadratic form, a standard problem format acceptable to a quantum annealer. Our formulation was tested for small-scale problem instances using the quantum-classical hybrid platform PyQUBO and we discuss the computational challenges and propose several potential improvements to the formulation.},

In this paper, a novel hybrid algorithm is proposed and applied in the docking environment of AutoDock version 4.2.6 in order to enhance the accuracy and the efficiency for dockings with flexible ligands. This search algorithm, called entropy-based Lamarckian quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (ELQPSO), is a combination of the QPSO with an entropy-based update strategy and the Solis and Wet local search (SWLS) method. By using the PDBbind core set v.2016, the ELQPSO is compared with the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA), Lamarckian particle swarm optimization (LPSO) and Lamarckian QPSO (LQPSO). The experimental results reveal that the corresponding docking program of ELQPSO, named as EQDOCK in this paper, has a competitive performance in dealing with the protein-ligand docking problems. Moreover, for the test cases with different number of torsions, the EQDOCK outperforms the other three docking programs in finding docking conformations with small root mean squared deviation (RMSD) values in most cases. In particular, it has an advantage of solving highly flexible ligand docking problems over the others.},

abstract = {Abstract Quantum technologies is an emerging field of physics and engineering based on exploiting properties of quantum mechanics such as entanglement, superposition, or tunneling, and which is expected to impact many applications, such as communications, simulation, computation, or sensing and metrology. The operation of quantum technologies is based on the manipulation of the quantum states of certain devices, either to induce transitions between states or to detect the transitions. Irrespective of the practical realization of these quantum devices, their manipulation requires interacting with their quantum resonant states, for which very narrow radio-frequency (RF) bursts in the range of the GHz are required. Arbitrary waveform generators are used to generate these signals for test purposes, but this is not suitable for practical quantum technology applications, which will need to produce the required bursts by specific circuit building blocks with low power and small dimensions. Here, an integrated RF burst generator capable of producing GHz bursts shorter than 1 ns is presented. The proposed architecture is tested using a 5 GHz quadrature LC-tank voltage-controlled oscillator (LC-VCO), showing that the four equally spaced phases can be switched every 500 ps, which allows the generation of more complex RF bursts for optimized quantum state manipulation.},

abstract = {Abstract Infrastructure inspection and assessment such as pavement distress classification remains a critical challenge for infrastructure maintenance. Traditional manual inspections are labor-intensive, costly, and subject to subjective bias, while classical machine learning models demand extensive computational resources for large-scale evaluations. These challenges have driven growing interest in quantum computing, which theoretically offers increased computational efficiency and the potential to process high-dimensional data with fewer parameters compared to classical approaches. This study investigates the feasibility and performance of Hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Models (HQCCMs) specifically designed for infrastructure image classification. Two distinct HQCCMs are proposed: the Parallel Angle-Encoded Hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Model (PA-HQCCM) and the Single Amplitude-Encoded Hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Model (SA-HQCCM). The core novelty of these hybrid architectures lies in the effective integration of quantum convolutional layers, classical convolutional operations, and parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) into a unified framework, enabling the models to leverage the inherent compactness and representational efficiency of quantum feature extraction. Experimental results reveal that HQCCMs achieve a test accuracy improvement of approximately 3.0\% beyond comparable classical CNN baselines, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Comprehensive ablation studies quantify the distinct advantages delivered by the quantum components, while generalization capabilities are assessed by unseen images. The study further examines the influence of measurement strategies, quantum noise, and circuit configurations on model performance, offering valuable insights into optimizing HQCCMs. Overall, these findings underscore the transformative potential of quantum-enhanced architectures in resource-constrained environments, offering a scalable, image-driven tool for rapid pavement condition screening.},

In this work, a feature selection method is proposed with a specific focus on QML. This scheme treats the light-cones (i.e., subspace) of quantum models as features and then select relevant ones through training of the corresponding local quantum kernels. Its versatility is numerically demonstrated for four different applications using toy tasks: (1) feature selection of classical inputs, (2) circuit architecture search for data embedding, (3) compression of quantum machine learning models and (4) subspace selection for quantum data.

However, in reality, the simulation efficiency of the large-scale simulator is low on a single node.

After many experiments, we found that much computational redundancy and frequent memory access are important factors that hinder the efficient operation of the CPU. This paper proposes a new powerful and simple quantum computing simulator: PAS (power and simple). Compared with existing simulators, PAS introduces four novel optimization methods: efficient hybrid vectorization, fast bitwise operation, memory access filtering, and quantum tracking. In the experiment, we tested the QFT (quantum Fourier transform) and RQC (random quantum circuits) of 21 to 30 qubits and selected the state-of-the-art simulator QuEST (quantum exact simulation toolkit) as the benchmark.

abstract = {Purpose Modern inverse radiotherapy treatment planning requires nonconvex, large-scale optimizations that must be solved within a clinically feasible timeframe. We have developed and tested a quantum-inspired, stochastic algorithm for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT): quantum tunnel annealing (QTA). By modeling the likelihood probability of accepting a higher energy solution after a particle tunneling through a potential energy barrier, QTA features an additional degree of freedom (the barrier width, w) not shared by traditional stochastic optimization methods such as Simulated Annealing (SA). This additional degree of freedom can improve convergence rates and achieve a more efficient and, potentially, effective treatment planning process. Methods To analyze the character of the proposed QTA algorithm, we chose two stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) liver cases of variable complexity. The “easy” first case was used to confirm functionality, while the second case, with a more challenging geometry, was used to characterize and evaluate the QTA algorithm performance. Plan quality was assessed using dose-volume histogram-based objectives and dose distributions. Due to the stochastic nature of the solution search space, extensive tests were also conducted to determine the optimal smoothing technique, ensuring balance between plan deliverability and the resulting plan quality. QTA convergence rates were investigated in relation to the chosen barrier width function, and QTA and SA performances were compared regarding sensitivity to the choice of solution initializations, annealing schedules, and complexity of the dose-volume constraints. Finally, we investigated the extension from beamlet intensity optimization to direct aperture optimization (DAO). Influence matrices were calculated using the Eclipse scripting application program interface (API), and the optimizations were run on the University of Michigan's high-performance computing cluster, Flux. Results Our results indicate that QTA’s barrier-width function can be tuned to achieve faster convergence rates. The QTA algorithm reached convergence up to 46.6\% faster than SA for beamlet intensity optimization and up to 26.8\% faster for DAO. QTA and SA were ultimately found to be equally insensitive to the initialization process, but the convergence rate of QTA was found to be more sensitive to the complexity of the dose-volume constraints. The optimal smoothing technique was found to be a combination of a Laplace-of-Gaussian (LOG) edge-finding filter implemented as a penalty within the objective function and a two-dimensional Savitzky–Golay filter applied to the final iteration; this achieved total monitor units more than 20\% smaller than plans optimized by commercial treatment planning software. Conclusions We have characterized the performance of a stochastic, quantum-inspired optimization algorithm, QTA, for radiotherapy treatment planning. This proof of concept study suggests that QTA can be tuned to achieve faster convergence than SA; therefore, QTA may be a good candidate for future knowledge-based or adaptive radiation therapy applications.},

A comprehensive multi-vocal literature review was performed and culled a total of 49 academic papers for data extraction. A total of 13 challenges encountered by organisations were identified during the adoption of QC. Subsequently, these challenges were examined deeply and determined that five of them are the most critical, these are ‘Lack of quantum specific algorithms, dev and testing methodologies’, ‘Difficult compilation and debugging’, ‘Lack of development tools and technology’, ‘Lack of development guidelines \& Quality Assurance Standards’ and ‘Lack of professional expert’, together founding over 30\% of occurrences. These challenges from various perspectives were evaluated, including time frame, methodology, geographical region and publication platform.

Using differentiable quantum circuits (DQCs) with a feature map encoding of latent variables, the quantile function is represented for an underlying probability distribution and samples extracted as DQC expectation values. Using quantile mechanics the system is propagated in time, thereby allowing for time-series generation. The method is tested by simulating the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and sampling at times different from the initial point, as required in financial analysis and dataset augmentation. Additionally, continuous quantum generative adversarial networks (qGANs) are analyzed, and the authors show that they represent quantile functions with a modified (reordered) shape that impedes their efficient time-propagation. The results shed light on the connection between quantum quantile mechanics (QQM) and qGANs for SDE-based distributions, and point the importance of differential constraints for model training, analogously with the recent success of physics informed neural networks.},

abstract = {Abstract Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) with a unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz has been suggested as a promising method for electronic structure calculations on future quantum computers. However, the complexity of the excitation terms for UCC with the single and double excitations (UCCSD) ansatz is up-bounded to OM−N2N2, where N is the number of electrons and M is the number of spin orbitals. The gate complexity of quantum circuit for the UCCSD ansatz is up-bounded to OMM−N2N2 using the Jordan–Wigner transformation. These complexities significantly limit the implementation of UCCSD on current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Herein, we developed a k-QUpCCGSD ansatz which is based on the generalized paired double excitation operators and the particle preserving exchange gate. The former reduces the number of the excitation operators, the latter reduces the number of qubit gates for transforming excitation operators to quantum circuit. The gate complexity of the proposed k-QUpCCGSD ansatz is up-bounded to O(kM2), which significantly reduce the complexity of the VQE algorithm on NISQ devices. The performance of the proposed ansatz on VQE is demonstrated by calculating ground-state dissociation energy curves of the H6, LiH, H2O, and BeH2 molecules with the STO-3G minimal basis set, and the accuracy is evaluated by comparing to the full configuration interaction (FCI) benchmarks. Moreover, we compare the number of quantum gates, especially the CNOT gates, and accuracies of various ansatzes. The assessments have shown that the accuracy of qubit unitary coupled cluster (QUCC) ansatzes is slightly worse than that of the UCC ones, but the circuit complexity of QUCC is much less than that of UCC. Among the tested QUCC ansatzes, k-QUpCCGSD achieves higher accuracy with fewer quantum gates than QUCCSD, and k-QUpCCGSD is a promising ansatz for VQE calculation on NISQ devices.},

In this paper we test QCBM performance on a dataset of spot FX log-returns (heavy-tailed distribution) as well as specially constructed mixture of Normal distributions (which models spiky light-tailed distribution). The QCBM has greater expressive power than comparable classical neural networks such as restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and, therefore, has potential to demonstrate quantum advantage by generating high-quality samples from the learned empirical distribution of the market risk factors while using less computational resources than its classical counterpart. However, efficient training of QCBM remains a challenging problem. Traditional differentiable learning approach may not work well when the loss function is highly non-smooth. In such cases it may be more efficient to use the non-differentiable learning methods. This paper proposes a non-differentiable learning approach to the training of QCBM based on genetic glgorithm (GA). The paper also presents results of the numerical experiments which compare performance of QCBM trained with GA against performance of the equivalent classical RBM and investigates the question of GA convergence as a function of QCBM architecture and the choice of algorithm's hyperparameters.},

abstract = {Abstract Entanglement plays an indispensable role in numerous quantum information and quantum computation tasks, underscoring the need for efficiently verifying entangled states. In recent years, quantum state verification has received increasing attention, yet the challenge of addressing noise effects in implementing this approach remains unsolved. In this work, a systematic assessment of the performance of quantum state verification protocols is provided in the presence of measurement noise. Based on the analysis, a necessary and sufficient condition is provided to uniquely identify the target state under noisy measurements. Moreover, this work proposes a symmetric hypothesis testing verification algorithm with noisy measurements. Then, relying on \$W\$ states, a semidefinite program is demonstrated to calculate the infidelity threshold for arbitrary measurement noise. Subsequently, using a noisy nonadaptive verification strategy of Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger and stabilizer states, the noise effects on the verification efficiency are analytically illustrated. From both analytical and numerical perspectives, this work demonstrates that the noisy verification protocol exhibits a negative quadratic relationship between the sample complexity and the infidelity. The method can be easily applied to real experimental settings, thereby demonstrating its promising prospects.},

However, the meaningful randomness of Boson sampling results has not been utilized or exploited. In this research, Boson sampling is applied to design a quantum random number generator (QRNG) by fully exploiting the randomness of Boson sampling results, and its prototype system is constructed with the programmable silicon photonic processor, which can generate unbiased random sequences and overcome the shortcomings of the existing discrete QRNGs such as source-restricted, high demand for the photon number resolution capability of detector and slow self-detection generator speed. Boson sampling is implemented as a random entropy source, and random bit strings with satisfactory randomness and uniformity can be obtained after post-processing the sampling results. It is the first approach for applying the randomness of Boson sampling results to develop a practical prototype system for actual tasks, and the experiment results demonstrate that the designed Boson sampling-based QRNG prototype system passes 15 tests of the NIST SP 800-22 statistical test component, which proves that Boson sampling has great potential for practical applications with desirable performance besides quantum advantage.},

abstract = {Abstract Scanning tunneling microscope (STM) has presented a revolutionary methodology to nanoscience and nanotechnology. It enables imaging of the topography of surfaces, mapping the distribution of electronic density of states, and manipulating individual atoms and molecules, all at atomic resolutions. In particular, atom manipulation capability has evolved from fabricating individual nanostructures toward the scalable production of the atomic-sized devices bottom-up. The combination of precision synthesis and in situ characterization has enabled direct visualization of many quantum phenomena and fast proof-of-principle testing of quantum device functions with immediate feedback to guide improved synthesis. Several representative examples are reviewed to demonstrate the recent development of atomic-scale manipulation, focusing on progress that addresses quantum properties by design in several technologically relevant materials systems. Integration of several atomically precisely controlled probes in a multiprobe STM system vastly extends the capability of in situ characterization to a new dimension where the charge and spin transport behaviors can be examined from mesoscopic to atomic length scale. The automation of atomic-scale manipulation and the integration with well-established lithographic processes further push this bottom-up approach to a new level that combines reproducible fabrication, extraordinary programmability, and the ability to produce large-scale arrays of quantum structures.},

The first circuit is a double quantum dot connected to two electron reservoirs, while the second one is a quantum point contact in the weak tunneling limit. The coupling is such that an electron in the first circuit enhances the barrier of the point contact and, thus, reduces its conductivity. While such setups are frequently used as charge monitors, we focus on two different aspects. First, we derive transport coefficients which have recently been employed for testing generalized equilibrium conditions known as exchange fluctuation relations. These formally exact relations allow us to test the consistency of our master equation approach. Second, a biased point contact entails noise on the DQD and induces non-equilibrium phenomena such as a ratchet current.},

abstract = {Abstract In this study, the on-chip generation of microwave signals are proposed for controlling nearby quantum bits in a low-temperature environment, utilizing superconducting logical and RF components. To achieve enhanced amplitude of the microwave, superconducting single flux quantum (SFQ) pulse pairs are employed, which can have either the same or reversal polarity, serving as the basic elements of the generator. The SFQ pulse pairs are then combined and wave-shaped by using a microwave combining filter, which finally outputs desired microwave signals with narrow line-width. The amplitude of the microwave signal correlates with the interval between two SFQ pulses in a pair and can be adjusted accordingly. To validate the proposal, test chips are fabricated and performed experiments. The experimental results confirm that the method using a reverse-polarity pulse can maximize the output microwave amplitude and provide control of the initial phase of the output microwave. This improvement offers a superior alternative for generating microwaves using superconducting circuits to control quantum bits.},

abstract = {Abstract Currently, a wide range of newly designed devices are based on high-end quantum technologies. To successfully design a quantum system, it is necessary to appropriately address the increasing complexity which exists in the development procedure of the system. A suitable approach to deal with this problem is to employ systems engineering models and integrate them with domain engineering tools. The model-based systems engineering (MBSE) methodology is commonly used to analyze, design, manufacture, and test various complex systems. In this paper, the MBSE approach is chosen for the development of quantum dot solar cells as a typical quantum system and to deal with the complexity existing in this procedure. The analysis, manufacturing, and verification, validation, and testing (VV\&T) for this system are described using SysML in Cameo Systems Modeler software to represent the role of models in this regard. Then a detailed design is performed in MATLAB and integrated with SysML to identify how changing various parameters during the system development process affects the overall system performance. This technique facilitates the communication between different engineering teams and helps to manage the complexity in the entire system lifecycle.},

To verify the performance of the proposed EWQPSO, several tests involving Ipersphere, Alpine, De Jong, Zakharov, Salomon functions were carried out. The obtained results demonstrated that the convergence is achieved more quickly by the EWPSO than other optimization algorithms based on QPSO. A lumped element equivalent circuit was designed to model the terminal impedance of a broadband planar sinuous antenna in the frequency range from 1 to 3 GHz. The developed EWQPSO algorithm is then used to recover all the parameters characterizing the equivalent circuit. The resulting circuit exhibited a good impedance fidelity over the whole frequency range.},

abstract = {Purpose: To independently verify leaf positions in so-called dynalog files for a Varian iX linac with a Millennium 120 MLC. This verification provides a measure of confidence that the files can be used directly as part of a more extensive intensity modulated radiation therapy / volumetric modulated arc therapy QA program. Methods: Initial testing used white paper placed at the collimator plane and a standard hand-held digital camera to image the light and shadow of a static MLC field through the paper. Known markings on the paper allow for image calibration. Noise reduction was attempted with removal of ‘inherent noise’ from an open-field light image through the paper, but the method was found to be inconsequential. This is likely because the environment could not be controlled to the precision required for the sort of reproducible characterization of the quantum noise needed in order to meaningfully characterize and account for it. A multi-scale iterative edge detection algorithm was used for localizing the leaf ends. These were compared with the planned locations from the treatment console. Results: With a very basic setup, the image of the central bank A leaves 15–45, which are arguably the most important for beam modulation, differed from the planned location by [0.38±0.28] mm. Similarly, for bank B leaves 15–45 had a difference of [0.42±0.28] mm Conclusion: It should be possible to determine leaf position accurately with not much more than a modern hand-held camera and some software. This means we can have a periodic and independent verification of the dynalog file information. This is indicated by the precision already achieved using a basic setup and analysis methodology. Currently, work is being done to reduce imaging and setup errors, which will bring the leaf position error down further, and allow meaningful analysis over the full range of leaves.},

abstract = {Abstract Transition amplitudes and transition probabilities are relevant to many areas of physics simulation, including the calculation of response properties and correlation functions. These quantities can also be related to solving linear systems of equations. This study presents three related algorithms for calculating transition probabilities. First, a previously published short-depth algorithm is extended, allowing for the two input states to be non-orthogonal. Building on this first procedure, a higher-depth algorithm based on Trotterization and Richardson extrapolation is derived that requires fewer circuit evaluations. Third, a tunable algorithm that allows for trading off circuit depth and measurement complexity is introduced, yielding an algorithm that can be tailored to specific hardware characteristics. Finally, proof-of-principle numerics are presented for models in physics and chemistry and for a subroutine in variational quantum linear solving (VQLS). The primary benefits of these approaches are that a) arbitrary non-orthogonal states may now be used with small increases in quantum resources, b) they (like another recently proposed method) entirely avoid subroutines such as the Hadamard test that may require three-qubit gates to be decomposed, and c) in some cases fewer quantum circuit evaluations are required as compared to the previous state-of-the-art in NISQ algorithms for transition probabilities.},

abstract = {Abstract Multi-class classification problems are fundamental in many varied domains in research and industry. A popular strategy for solving multi-class classification problems involves first transforming the problem into many binary classification problems. However, this requires the number of binary classification models that need to be developed to grow with the number of classes. Recent work in quantum machine learning has seen the development of multi-class quantum classifiers that circumvent this growth by learning a mapping between the data and a set of label states. This work presents the first multi-class SWAP-Test classifier inspired by its binary predecessor and the use of label states in recent work. With this classifier, the cost of developing multiple models is avoided. In contrast to previous work, the number of qubits required, the measurement strategy, and the topology of the circuits used is invariant to the number of classes. In addition, unlike other architectures for multi-class quantum classifiers, the state reconstruction of a single qubit yields sufficient information for multi-class classification tasks. Both analytical results and numerical simulations show that this classifier is not only effective when applied to diverse classification problems but also robust to certain conditions of noise.},

In this research, we propose a heuristic adaptive quantum routing (RWTA\_AQR) algorithm for routing, wavelength and timeslot assignment. RWTA\_AQR utilises the FirstFit algorithm to assign wavelengths in both contiguous and noncontiguous timeslots for optimal resource utilisation based on the priority. To verify its effectiveness, the proposed RWTA\_AQR is tested on NSFNET and UBN24 network topologies under diversified traffic models, towards low as well as high demand, network congestion scenarios. We use network security performance (NSP), success ratio of connection requests, timeslot utilisation, quantum key utilisation, blocking probability (BP) and security downgrade ratio as metrics to prove its effectiveness against the existing methods based on flexible security level, strict security level and classical approach. The results demonstrate that RWTA\_AQR performs better by allowing NSP of up to 90\% and having the lowest BP (below 10\%) at lower traffic load. The proposed solution provides a systematic trade-off in security and resource utilisation with controlled overhead for improving the performance of QKD-SDONs in dynamic resource-constrained environments.},

abstract = {Abstract The highly efficient excitation energy transfer (EET) processes in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes have attracted much recent research interests. Experimentally, spectroscopic studies have provided important information on the energetics and EET dynamics. Theoretically, due to the large number of degrees of freedom and the complex interaction between the pigments and the protein environment, it is impossible to simulate the whole system quantum mechanically. Effective Hamiltonian models are often used, in which the most important degrees of freedom are treated explicitly and all the other degrees of freedom are treated as a thermal bath. However, even with such simplifications, solving the real-time quantum dynamics could still be a difficult task. A particular challenging case in simulating the EET dynamics and related spectroscopic phenomena lies in the so-called intermediate coupling regime, where the intermolecular electronic couplings and the electronic–vibrational couplings are of similar strength. In this article, we review theoretical studies of linear and nonlinear spectroscopic signals of photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes, using the nonperturbative hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach. Simulations were performed for the EET dynamics, various types of linear spectra, two-dimensional electronic spectra, and pump–probe spectra. Benchmark tests of several approximate methods related to the HEOM approach were also discussed. The results show that the nonperturbative HEOM approach is an effective method in simulating the EET dynamics and spectroscopic signals of photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes. Important insights into EET pathways, quantum effects including quantum delocalization, and quantum coherence in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes were also obtained through such simulations.

abstract = {Summary Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising technology for next-generation photovoltaic devices because of their ease of fabrication and high power conversion efficiency (PCE). The main obstacle that limits the commercialization of large-area PSCs is the lack of suitable solution-processable low-temperature fabrication methods and the perovskite material's chemical stability. With an increase in the active area of the cell, the defect states and the series resistance of the device increase, which is undesirable. We have demonstrated a repeatable fabrication method of small (0.25 cm2) and large (2.0 cm2) active area devices with Au and Cu as back contact electrodes. Small area perovskite devices with Cu and Au contact electrodes showed a PCE of 9.87\% and 10.42\%, respectively. When scaled up to 2.0 cm2, the devices showed a minor drop in the open-circuit voltage, but a significant decrease in photocurrent was observed. Large-area PSCs with Cu and Au contacts displayed a PCE of 5.61\% and 5.92\%, respectively. External quantum efficiency measurements at four different points provided similar results, thus confirming the uniformity of large-area devices. The stability of large-area devices under ambient environment conditions was tested for more than 7 weeks. Gold-based PSC retained almost 75\% of its initial PCE when stored in ambient conditions for 50 days, whereas Cu-based devices showed a significant decrease in efficiency in the same period. Degradation in efficiency of PSCs occurred primarily due to the loss in photocurrent arising from active layer degradation. Simulations of perovskite devices carried out using Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS)-1D software also showed that similar efficiencies of PSCs may be obtained using Cu, instead of Au, as the low-cost metal contact. Novelty Statement Large-area perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on gold and copper metal contacts have been fabricated, and copper contacts provide efficiencies comparable with the values obtained with gold contacts. The study shows that copper can be used as a low-cost alternative to gold to fabricate large-area, high-efficiency PSCs. Stability testing under ambient conditions has been carried out for 50 days to compare the performance of gold- and copper-based large-area PSCs.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Satellite communication systems are important in global information exchange in areas such as military security, weather forecasting, and telecommunications. Advanced encryption standard (AES) is widely used in satellite communication due to its robustness and efficiency. However, conventional AES implementations focus primarily on encryption and decryption, which require further improvements in attack resilience, particularly against adversaries that use machine learning–based cryptanalysis and quantum threats. This paper examines the use of AES algorithms to protect data transmission over satellite communications. It introduces novel modifications to AES, incorporating machine unlearning as a defensive mechanism against attacks, chaotic injection for enhanced key unpredictability, and a quantum-inspired approach based on wavefunction collapse to mislead attackers. Machine unlearning dynamically alters cryptographic states upon intrusion detection, preventing key recovery. Chaotic injection is explored in the S-Box and key scheduling process to introduce controlled unpredictability without compromising reversibility. Additionally, a quantum circuit representation of AES is proposed, where an adversarial attack induces a wavefunction collapse, leading to incorrect but deterministic outputs. Performance evaluation under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) conditions demonstrates that the proposed AES achieves an average encryption throughput of 194 Mbps with only 3.2\% additional computational overhead, whereas entropy analysis shows 7.85–7.92 bits/byte, with an improvement of 1.08\% over standard AES and expanding the effective key space by approximately 6.6 times. Comparative security testing shows a 25\% increase in resistance to differential attacks. Empirical machine learning attacks demonstrate a drop in classifier accuracy from approximately 92.3\% for the baseline AES to 55.5\% for the proposed scheme. These results confirm that the proposed modifications significantly strengthen AES while maintaining computational efficiency for real-world satellite communication scenarios.}

abstract = {Abstract The emerging technology of reversible circuits offers a potential solution to the synthesis of ultra low-power quantum computing systems. A reversible circuit can be envisaged as a cascade of reversible gates only, such as Toffoli gate, which has two components: k control bits and a target bit (k-CNOT), k ≥ 1. While analysing testability issues in a reversible circuit, the missing-gate fault model is often used for modelling physical defects in k-CNOT gates. A new design-for-testability (DFT) technique is proposed for reversible circuits that deploys bit-swapping using Fredkin reversible gates. It is shown that in an (n × n) circuit implemented with k-CNOT gates, addition of only two extra inputs along with a few Fredkin gates yields easy testability in the circuit. The modified design admits a universal test set of maximum size 2n + 1 that detects all detectable missing gate faults in the original circuit, where n is the number of input/output lines in the circuit. The DFT overhead in terms of quantum cost is much less compared to that of previous approaches. The method is more advantageous for large circuits.},

abstract = {Summary To design a micro PV panel, thousands of photons have been produced from a single photon by breaking down its photonic structure using Higgs-Boson BR (H → γγ¯) quantum field under high temperature conditions. Because the Higgs-Boson BR (H → γγ¯) Quantum can be excited under high temperature conditions which forms extremely short-range week force by the photon-photon collusion of the bare ions; thus, a pair photon (e+e−) is created from a single photon. This pair of photon can be dissociated by 2 surface semiconductors of the photovoltaic panel and further dispersed by the 3 diodes superconducting silicon surface to form multiple photons, here named as Hossain Multiple Photons (HmP¯). A mathematical test has been performed by applying MATLAB software, which revealed that production of HmP¯ [1photon = (1 + 1 = 2photons) = (2photons + 2photons)2surface = 16photon = (16photons)3diode = ∑4,096photons] from a single phone is doable through photon-photon collusion, photon dissociation, and photon scattering process into the Higgs-Boson BR (H → γγ¯) quantum field under high temperature condition. These multiple photons can be converted from direct current into alternating current for commercial use. Calculation revealed that 1590.9 MW/h clean energy can be produced by merely 1 cm2 PV panel which indeed would be a new field of science that will substantially satisfy the total global energy demand.},

abstract = {The adequate choice of the docking target function impacts the accuracy of the ligand positioning as well as the accuracy of the protein-ligand binding energy calculation. To evaluate a docking target function we compared positions of its minima with the experimentally known pose of the ligand in the protein active site. We evaluated five docking target functions based on either the MMFF94 force field or the PM7 quantum-chemical method with or without implicit solvent models: PCM, COSMO, and SGB. Each function was tested on the same set of 16 protein-ligand complexes. For exhaustive low-energy minima search the novel MPI parallelized docking program FLM and large supercomputer resources were used. Protein-ligand binding energies calculated using low-energy minima were compared with experimental values. It was demonstrated that the docking target function on the base of the MMFF94 force field in vacuo can be used for discovery of native or near native ligand positions by finding the low-energy local minima spectrum of the target function. The importance of solute-solvent interaction for the correct ligand positioning is demonstrated. It is shown that docking accuracy can be improved by replacement of the MMFF94 force field by the new semiempirical quantum-chemical PM7 method.},

The development of an absorber layer, transparent conducting oxide window layer, and module design was the key focus. This permitted 1.8\% higher efficiency than our last experimental result. The quantity and the injection time of the sodium were controlled, resulting in higher open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current (Jsc). In order to increase Jsc, we changed the thickness of the window layer. Boron-doped zinc oxide was optimized for higher transmittance without reducing the fill factor. The uniformity of each layer was improved, and patterns were optimized for each module. Therefore, Voc, Jsc, and FF could be theoretically improved on the reported results of, respectively, 20 mV, 2 mA/cm2, and 1.4\%. The module's efficiency was measured at the Korea Test Laboratory to compare with the data obtained in-house. Various analyses were performed, including secondary ion mass spectroscopy, photoluminescence, quantum efficiency, solar simulator, and UV–vis spectrometry, to measure the cell's depth profile, carrier lifetime, external quantum efficiency, module efficiency, and transmittance, respectively.

abstract = {Quantitative structure–retention relationship study was carried out for predicting the retention times of twenty-six 1-(2-naphtyl)-1 ethanol ester enantiomers in high-pressure liquid chromatography by using original molecular, quantum mechanical, and multivariate image analysis (MIA) descriptors. Multiple linear regressions, partial least squares (PLS), and partial component regression (PCR) models combined with genetic algorithm (GA) were constructed as variable selection methods by using molecular descriptors to investigate the potential relationship between the selected descriptors and the retention times of the enantiomers. The molecular descriptors were generated from the molecular structure of enantiomers and calculated by the DRAGON software. Besides 504 DRAGON descriptors, additional 38 quantum mechanical descriptors were obtained using density functional theory/B3LYP/6-31G method. Then, the results of the obtained models were compared with MIA descriptors that are pixels of two-dimensional (2D) chemical structures. MIA descriptors were analyzed by correlation ranking-PCR and PLS methods. The predictive ability of the models was evaluated using cross-validation and an external test set. The results showed that GA is a good method for variable selection using structural descriptors combined with the PLS model. Since MIA descriptors are 2D pixels of the chemical structures, they can differentiate between the (R) and (S) isomers of enantiomers better than the quantum mechanical and structural descriptors. Comparison between the different models indicated that the GA-PLS and MIA-PLS models were the best methods.},

TRNGs can be realised from the sampling of quantum phenomena, for instance, the detection of single photons. Here, a recently proposed technique, which implements a quantum random number generator (QRNG) out of a device that was realised for a different scope, is further analysed and certified [1]. The combination of a CMOS single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array, a high-resolution time-to-digital converter (TDC) implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA), the exploitation of a single-photon temporal degree of freedom, and an unbiased procedure provided by H. Zhou and J. Bruck [2, 3] allows the generation of true random bits with a high bitrate in a compact and easy-to-calibrate device. Indeed, the use of the ‘Zhou–Bruck’ method allows the removal of any correlation from the binary representation of decimal data. This perfectly fits with the usage of a device with non-idealities like SPAD's afterpulses, pixel cross-correlation, and time-to-digital converter non-uniform conversion. In this work, an in-depth analysis and certification of the technique presented in [1] is provided by processing the data with the NIST suite tests in order to prove the effectiveness and validity of this approach.},

abstract = {Abstract Although the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of colloidal quantum dot solar cells (CQDSCs) has increased sharply, researchers are struggling with the lack of comprehensive device efficiency optimization strategies, which retards significant progress in CQDSC improvement. This paper addresses this critical issue through analyzing the impact of colloidal quantum dot (CQD) carrier hopping mobility, bandgap energy, illumination intensity, and electrode/CQD interface on device performance to develop a guiding criterion for CQDSC PCE optimization. This general strategy has been used for the successful fabrication of high-efficiency CQDSCs yielding certified PCEs as high as 11.28 \%. A major experimental finding of this work is that the widely used constant photocurrent density (Jph) assumption is invalid as Jph is external-voltage dependent due to the low carrier hopping mobility. Furthermore, the theoretical model developed herein predicts the nonmonotonic dependence of CQDSC PCE on carrier hopping mobility and bandgap energy, which were also demonstrated with the high-efficiency CQDSCs. These results constitute a revision basis of the widespread belief that higher mobility and lower bandgap energy correspond to a higher CQDSC efficiency. Furthermore, electrode/CQD interface-dependent surface recombination velocities were investigated in the framework of our abovementioned theoretical model using lock-in carrierography, a contactless, large-area frequency-domain photocarrier diffusion-wave imaging methodology that elucidated the carrier collection process at the electrodes through open-circuit voltage distribution imaging. Lock-in carrierography eliminates the limitations of today's widely used small-spot (<0.1 cm2) testing methods which, however, raise questionable overall solar cell performance and stability estimations.},

The SEnM runs with an ensemble consisting of finite copies of a single probabilistic machine, hence is as powerful as a probabilistic Turing machine (PTM). Then the hypothesis—that is, the SEnM can effectively simulate a general circuit model of QC—is tested by introducing an information-theoretic inequality, named readout inequality. The inequality is satisfied by the SEnM and imposes a critical condition: if the hypothesis holds, the inequality should be satisfied by the probing model of QC. However, it is shown that the above hypothesis is not generally accepted with the inequality violation; namely, such a simulation necessarily fails, implying that PTM ⊆ QC.},

abstract = {Abstract A longstanding project of the chemical kinetics community is to predict reaction rates and the behavior of reacting systems, even for systems where there are no experimental data. Many important reacting systems (atmosphere, combustion, pyrolysis, partial oxidations) involve a large number of reactions occurring simultaneously, and reaction intermediates that have never been observed, making this goal even more challenging. Improvements in our ability to compute rate coefficients and other important parameters accurately from first principles, and improvements in automated kinetic modeling software, have partially overcome many challenges. Indeed, in some cases quite complicated kinetic models have been constructed which accurately predicted the results of independent experiments. However, the process of constructing the models, and deciding which reactions to measure or compute ab initio, relies on accurate estimates (and indeed most of the numerical rate parameters in most large kinetic models are estimates.) Machine-learned models trained on large datasets can improve the accuracy of these estimates, and allow a better integration of quantum chemistry and experimental data. The need for continued development of shared (perhaps open-source) software and databases, and some directions for improvement, are highlighted. As we model more complicated systems, many of the weaknesses of the traditional ways of doing chemical kinetic modeling, and of testing kinetic models, have been exposed, identifying several challenges for future research by the community.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Alzheimer's Disease is in a class of related neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies, where tau hyperphosphorylation leads to progressive neurological decline. MSUT-2 has emerged as a viable target for the treatment of tauopathies like Alzheimer's, as the protein's interactions with the tau protein could be central to the accumulation and aggregation of tau. Quantum Computing and Machine Learning are two developing fields that have the capability to completely revolutionize the field of pharmacology. Developed architectures like Quantum Support Vector Machines can be scaled up readily as technology improves, further enhancing this breakthrough field’s implications on pharmacology. Method In the first phase of research, OpenEye's FILTER software was employed, which eliminated a set of starting compounds from ChemBridge's EXPRESS-PICK Screening Library (over 500,000 compounds) that were predicted to be highly toxic and have low bioavailability. Next, a simple pharmacophore screen was performed using a set of known partial actives and inactives on OpenEye's ROCS tool. A modified Quantum Support Vector Machine algorithm was then run through IBM Qiskit. The model was trained using dozens of known chemical features of FDA-approved chemical actives and inactives. Compounds were featurized using data from SwissADME. Following preprocessing and training, the model was executed to predict known actives from the remaining set of test compounds. Finally, compounds were subject to a precise molecular docking trial with MSUT-2 (using OpenEye’s FRED tool and AUTODOCK Vina), where binding interaction strength was directly evaluated. Result This computational screening methodology resulted in numerous predicted inhibitors of MSUT-2. To validate the methodology of this screening workflow, numerous known FDA-approved drugs and actives for other diseases were successfully identified using the exact screening methodology utilized in this experiment through retrospective analysis. Conclusion In conclusion, a promising computational screening methodology partially validated with translational data using advancements in Quantum Machine Learning has been identified. This exact workflow is novel and promising, and can easily be scaled up for comprehensive screening for a myriad of targets. 5 inhibitors for a promising yet underexplored target for Alzheimer’s disease, MSUT-2, have also been identified in this study.},

The arc discharge light-induced TRNG (ALTRNG) is introduced, featuring wavelength-dependent photocurrent generation and arc discharge irradiation. A bipolar photo-responsive photodetector (BPPD) differentiates “1” and “0” states, producing highly random bits validated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 15 tests. The BPPD's response to deep-ultraviolet (DUV) and blue light enables distinct photocurrent generation under arc discharge illumination. The ALTRNG generates true random signals, yielding bit streams with unpredictability, uniform distribution, and stability.

Specifically, the formalism of causal hypothesis testing presented in [Nat Commun 10, 1472 (2019)] is considered. Through the algorithm, the existing definition of error probability is generalized, which is a metric to distinguish between two competing causal hypotheses, to a practical scenario. The results on the Qiskit validate the predicted speedup and show that in the realistic scenario, the error probability depends on the distance between the competing hypotheses. To achieve this, the causal hypotheses are embedded as a circuit construction of the oracle. Furthermore, by assessing the complexity involved in implementing the algorithm's subcomponents, a numerical estimation of the resources required for the algorithm is offered. Finally, applications of this framework for causal inference use cases in bioinformatics and artificial general intelligence are discussed.},

Its searching performance is better than the original particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), but the control parameters are less and easy to fall into local optimum. The paper proposed teamwork evolutionary strategy for balance global search and local search. This algorithm is based on a novel learning strategy consisting of cross-sequential quadratic programming and Gaussian chaotic mutation operators. The former performs the local search on the sample and the interlaced operation on the parent individual while the descendants of the latter generated by Gaussian chaotic mutation may produce new regions in the search space. Experiments performed on multimodal test and composite functions with or without coordinate rotation demonstrated that the population information could be utilized by the TEQPSO algorithm more effectively compared with the eight QSOs and PSOs variants. This improves the algorithm performance, significantly.},

Here, it is shown that the transparency of ZnO:Al can be improved and its refractive index can be reduced simultaneously by the addition of SiO2 into the layer. It is found that for low SiO2 concentrations, Si quenches oxygen vacancies and improves the layer transparency. At higher SiO2 concentrations a highly transparent amorphous compound of ZnxSiyO:Al forms, with a refractive index that scales down with the relative Si/Zn ratio. These layers are tested in Si heterojunction solar cells by inserting them between Si and the metallic rear contact of such devices. A consistent improvement is found in the cell short-circuit current density and external quantum efficiency with increasing Si incorporation.

Quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to test the dehydration performance of several designed ionic liquids. A candidate was selected for experimental synthesis and characterization. The impact of different ionic liquids on the vapor–liquid equilibrium of water was measured to confirm the feasibility, which indicates that the designed ILs exhibit a better dehydration potential compared to the basement solvent, 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate.

Generally, the errors of relative energies due to local approximations can be reduced to below 1 kcal/mol. The methods are well parallelized, and using small computer clusters with 100–200 computing cores, calculations for systems with 100–200 atoms using augmented triple-ζ basis sets can be carried out within a few hours of elapsed time.

abstract = {Purpose: To develop a data-mining methodology based on quantum clustering and machine learning to predict expected dosimetric endpoints for lung SBRT applications based on patient-specific anatomic features. Methods: Ninety-three patients who received lung SBRT at our clinic from 2011–2013 were retrospectively identified. Planning information was acquired for each patient, from which various features were extracted using in-house semi-automatic software. Anatomic features included tumor-to-OAR distances, tumor location, total-lung-volume, GTV and ITV. Dosimetric endpoints were adopted from RTOG-0195 recommendations, and consisted of various OAR-specific partial-volume doses and maximum point-doses. First, PCA analysis and unsupervised quantum-clustering was used to explore the feature-space to identify potentially strong classifiers. Secondly, a multi-class logistic regression algorithm was developed and trained to predict dose-volume endpoints based on patient-specific anatomic features. Classes were defined by discretizing the dose-volume data, and the feature-space was zero-mean normalized. Fitting parameters were determined by minimizing a regularized cost function, and optimization was performed via gradient descent. As a pilot study, the model was tested on two esophageal dosimetric planning endpoints (maximum point-dose, dose-to-5cc), and its generalizability was evaluated with leave-one-out cross-validation. Results: Quantum-Clustering demonstrated a strong separation of feature-space at 15Gy across the first-and-second Principle Components of the data when the dosimetric endpoints were retrospectively identified. Maximum point dose prediction to the esophagus demonstrated a cross-validation accuracy of 87\%, and the maximum dose to 5cc demonstrated a respective value of 79\%. The largest optimized weighting factor was placed on GTV-to-esophagus distance (a factor of 10 greater than the second largest weighting factor), indicating an intuitively strong correlation between this feature and both endpoints. Conclusion: This pilot study shows that it is feasible to predict dose-volume endpoints based on patient-specific anatomic features. The developed methodology can potentially help to identify patients at risk for higher OAR doses, thus improving the efficiency of treatment planning. R01-184173},

MOMAP starts to be popular after its first launch in 2015. How do you get into this specific field? Could you please share some experiences with our readers? I was trained with theoretical condensed matter physics in Fudan University. At that time, physicists have strong interests in low-dimensional system because the particular phenomenon has been predicted due to dimensionality. Conducting polymers have been quite a hot topic in the early 80’s since exotic elementary excitations as soliton and polaron have been demonstrated in such systems. Then, the field more and more moved towards theoretical chemistry since the interest in physics was suddenly turned to high Tc superconductivity and fractional quantum Hall effect. My supervisor Prof. Xin Sun and I have kept the interests, ever since the beginning. So, after my PhD in Fudan university, I went to Belgium to work with Prof. Jean-Luc Bredas, a known theoretical chemist working in the same field. It should be noted that the basic concepts derived from conducting polymers such as spin-charge separation and fractional charge have been pivotal to understand the novel quantum phenomena such as strongly correlated electrons and topological excitations in novel quantum materials. But the field itself (organic and polymeric optoelectronics) has become interdisciplinary but predominantly chemistry research. And the theory part has expanded the theoretical chemistry scope. So, very naturally, I turned my self to be a theoretical chemist. How do you supervise your students? As for theoretical and computational chemistry group, it is imperial to develop their own computational methodology. Nevertheless, applicability is the value of methodology. Namely, the purpose of methodology is to be applied. Thus, it is equally important for the group to do application work, especially, to collaborate with experimental groups by using our own developed methods. So, all my students need to do computational work either to test the applicability of the methodology or to understand the structure-property for the newly discovered experimental findings, or to clarify some debates in understanding the mechanism/processes. Some of the students have interests in math and physics and in writing program codes. They are stronly encouraged to develop methodology. I am lucky that I do have some excellent students with both motivation and solid math/physics background. I believe they will do better science than me in the future. And I hope they will also establish their own brand. I will be happy for that. But I am also very happy that the students coming to my group with little theory background but after a few years hard working, they can demonstrate important applications of quantum chemistry and lead to interesting findings by computational study, and they continue their academic career in computational chemistry. What is the most important personality for scientific research? Persistence! Chance will come (though only occasionally) to persistent people. Being smart is far from enough. What's your hobbies? What's your favorite book(s)? Swimming and music (Rock of the 60s). I like《上帝掷骰子吗?量子物理史话》by曹天元and all the books by Louis Cha (金庸). How do you keep balance between research and family? When you are young, say, before 40, you have to work very hard to establish yourself. Sacrificing family life seems inevitable. After that, it is easy to make a balance. Who influences you mostly in your life? My high school physics teacher influenced me most. At the time when GaoKao (高考) was not available, there was hardly any serious class education except my physics teacher. Under his guidance, I spent only 6 months to learn and master four years high school curriculum and got into college: in our school that time, less than 2\% can get into college, let alone good university as Sun Yet-sen University. This changed my life. What is your favorite journal(s)? The Journal of Chemical Physics, Physical Review B, the Journal of Physical Chemistry (Letters), and more and more, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation. We theorists usually do not publish or recognize important work in general chemistry journal. Popular is not necessary important, especially for theoretical work. Most of the Nobel Prize works in physical or theoretical chemistry were published in J. Chem. Phys. or Chem. Phys. Lett. (with impact factors around 3). Could you please give us some advices on improving Chinese Journal of Chemistry? CJC is a general chemistry journal. Chemistry with broad interest should be the most important priority. Thus, methodology paper is usually of less audience unless it demonstrated broad applicability or possibilities to open new fields of applications. If you have anything else to tell our readers, please feel free to do so. Keeping in mind to do different science is the most important thing to do. “First” rather than “better” work is always the top priority. Excited state decay for complex molecules consists of one of the most challenging issues for theoretical chemistry. By virtue of fast Fourier transformation we developed a highly efficient thermal vibration correlation function formalism for the excited state radiative and non-radiative decay rates, which transformed the conventional Fermi-Golden Rule into a time-dependent formalism and the time-consuming exponential scaling summation over vibrational states has been converted to an N3 scaling matrix production algorithm combined with time integration. It allows vibration mode mixing (Duschinsky rotation) effect, pertinent for large and soft organic molecules. Another important feature is promoting- mode free, rendering this method quite general. By replacing the non-adiabatic coupling prefactor with intermolecular electronic coupling term, the same formalism can be applied to modeling the carrier mobility in organic semiconductors (which is not discussed in this work). It has been implemented in a portable computational program package MOMAP, which has been successfully applied by many groups for the investigations of organic functional materials, for example, for fluorescent and phosphorescent emission, aggregation induced emission (AIE) phenomena, sensoring process for bilogical and environmental processes, coordinate compounds, thermally activated delayed fluorescence, as well as organic room temperature phosphorescence.},

Various LDSL have been tested with two different polymers and luminescent materials. These devices have been coupled with a CIGS solar cell. The CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QD) and Lumogen organic dyes are added in a polymeric scaffold to do a luminescent waveguide increasing the absorption in the UV range. The experimental short-circuit current are compared to the calculated short-circuit current. In this model, only the effects of the dyes were taken into account. It has been demonstrated a good correlation between the experimental and the theoretical values. Moreover, different coupling architectures have been experimented. The impact of the interface between LDSL and the solar device is not negligible. It has been experimentally proved the interface change can improve about 40–80\% with an ethanol interface. The increase can reach 60–90\% with a glycerine interface. The change of this interface impacts directly on the scattering effects and decrease the losses due to the surface defects.},

abstract = {This study describes the first Gray-code adder architecture, without the need to transform the Gray code into binary code, using the quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA). This device is a widely used resource for machine communications, counters, and encoders. QCA is a possible alternative to the current integrated circuit [complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)] due to its nanometric scale and very low-power consumption. In a bottom-up approach, the authors first describe and present the architecture of an important building block that composes the Gray-code adder, the parity generator, and then describe the full architecture. Besides being essential in the proposed adder, the parity generator is also important for error-checking and construction of other devices and widely used in communications. They demonstrate the functionality, test, and validate the proposed architectures using the QCADesigner simulator. If QCA consolidates as a possible CMOS substitute, this study can impact the design of future components that uses Gray-code and parity generator, such as embedded digital communications systems that will benefit from the low-power consumption of the QCA technology.},

These tools are user-friendly, but they provide a very rough (and sometimes misleading) estimation of the NMR properties, especially for complex systems. Rigorous and reliable ways to predict and interpret NMR properties of simple and complex systems are available in many popular computational program packages. Nevertheless, experimentalists keep relying on these “unreliable” tools in their daily work because, to have a sufficiently high accuracy, these rigorous quantum mechanical methods need high levels of theory. An alternative, efficient, semi-empirical approach has been proposed by Bally, Rablen, Tantillo, and coworkers. This idea consists of creating linear calibrations models, on the basis of the application of different combinations of functionals and basis sets. Following this approach, the predictive capability of a wider range of popular functionals was systematically investigated and tested. The NMR chemical shifts were computed in solvated phase at density functional theory level, using 30 different functionals coupled with three different triple–ζ basis sets. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

So far, such reconstruction methods for 1-RDM, not constrained to idempotency, have been tested only on a toy model system (CO2). In this work, a new method is assessed on crystalline urea [CO(NH2)2] using static (0 K) and dynamic (50 K) artificial experimental data. An improved model, including symmetry constraints and frozen core-electron contribution, is introduced to better handle the increasing system complexity. Reconstructed 1-RDMs, deformation densities and DCP anisotropy are analysed, and it is demonstrated that the changes in the model significantly improve the reconstruction quality, even when there is insufficient information and data corruption. The robustness of the model and the strategy are thus shown to be well adapted to address the reconstruction problem from actual experimental scattering data.},

The second class is a spirocyclic furo[3,4-c]pyrrole derivatives identified by virtual screening of a large chemical library of drug-like compounds performed in a previous study but confirmed in vitro here. In both cases, the prediction of inhibitory activity is based on the score of the SOL docking program, which uses the MMFF94 force field to calculate the binding energy. For the best ligands selected in virtual screening of the large chemical library, postprocessing with the PM7 semiempirical quantum-chemical method was used to calculate the enthalpy of protein-ligand binding to prioritize 16 compounds for testing in enzymatic assay, and one of them demonstrated micromolar activity. For triazolopyrimidine library, 21 compounds were prioritized for the testing based on docking scores, and visual inspection of docking poses. Of these, 4 compounds showed inhibition of factor XIIa at 30 μM.},

Recently, interface recombination was significantly reduced with alumina passivation, but other properties of Al2O3/CdSexTe1−x/Al2O3 heterostructures have not yet been investigated. Herein, further progress in understanding and developing polycrystalline heterostructures with x = 0.2 is reported.

Such polycrystalline CdSexTe1−x electronic characteristics match or exceed CdTe single-crystal properties. The resulting charge-carrier diffusion length of ≈14 μm is several times greater than the absorber thickness in test structures and in typical CdTe solar cells.

This work addresses the challenges of high-temperature stability of halide-passivated PbS CQDs by introducing bidentate aromatic ligands as a complementary passivation in liquid-phase ligand exchange. These ligands are shown to form robust bonds especially with CQDs {100} facets, effectively maintaining surface passivation and suppressing CQDs fusion at high temperatures. The CQDs films incorporating these ligands exhibit exceptional structural and chemical stability at 125 °C. Accelerated aging tests demonstrate that the CQDs photodiodes incorporating these ligands have long lifetimes of 168 h at 125 °C and 1500 h at 85 °C, which are over one-order-of-magnitude longer than the control devices with halides alone. The CQDs image sensors, monolithically integrating by the optimal CQDs photodiodes and readout circuit, could capture high-quality images until aging at 125 °C for 336 h. These findings support developing a scalable liquid-phase ligand exchange method using bidentate aromatic ligands to prepare high-temperature-stable CQDs image sensors.},

abstract = {Abstract The ignition, oxidation, and pyrolysis chemistry of methyl propyl ether (MPE) was probed experimentally at several different conditions, and a comprehensive chemical kinetic model was constructed to help understand the observations, with many of the key parameters computed using quantum chemistry and transition state theory. Experiments were carried out in a shock tube measuring time variation of CO concentrations, in a flow tube measuring product concentrations, and in a rapid compression machine (RCM) measuring ignition delay times. The detailed reaction mechanism was constructed using the Reaction Mechanism Generator software. Sensitivity and flux analyses were used to identify key rate and thermochemical parameters, which were then computed using quantum chemistry to improve the mechanism. Validation of the final model against the 1–20 bar 600–1500 K experimental data is presented with a discussion of the kinetics. The model is in excellent agreement with most of the shock tube and RCM data. Strong non-monotonic variation in conversion and product distribution is observed in the flow-tube experiments as the temperature is increased, and unusually strong pressure dependence and significant heat release during the compression stroke is observed in the RCM experiments. These observations are largely explained by a close competition between radical decomposition and addition to at different sites in MPE; this causes small shifts in conditions to lead to big shifts in the dominant reaction pathways. The validated mechanism was used to study the chemistry occurring during ignition in a diesel engine, simulated using Ignition Quality Test (IQT) conditions. At the IQT conditions, where the MPE concentration is higher, bimolecular reactions of peroxy radicals are much more important than in the RCM.},

abstract = {Abstract Shortwave infrared (SWIR) image sensors have unique functions in many optical applications, leading to widespread attention in developing next-generation materials and photodetector technologies. Organic photodetectors (OPDs) are highly promising due to their flexibility in molecular design and processability. However, integrating OPDs with silicon readout integrated circuits (ROICs) poses numerous challenges, often resulting in underestimated device performance and limiting technological progress. To address the requirements of integrating top-illuminated OPD with ROICs and to enhance the external quantum efficiency (EQE), optical microcavities are introduced into the OPDs. The EQE in the SWIR region can be effectively enhanced by properly adjusting the thicknesses of the photoactive layer (PAL) and interlayers. Simulations of the optical field distribution further support the active functions of the microcavity structure. The spatial variation of the microcavities allows the spectral response to shift from 1000 to 1400 nm, and the optimized device achieves an EQE of 25.8\% at 1260 nm. Finally, the OPDs are integrated with a silicon-based test kit, and the results reveal comparable sensing performance, demonstrating the high potential of microcavity resonance for device integration. This design effectively improves the integration of OPDs with traditional ROICs and advances SWIR-based organic image sensor technology further toward commercialization.},

abstract = {Abstract The great progress in organic photovoltaics (OPV) over the past few years has been largely achieved by the development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), with power conversion efficiencies now approaching 20\%. To further improve device performance, loss mechanisms must be identified and minimized. Triplet states are known to adversely affect device performance, since they can form energetically trapped excitons on low-lying states that are responsible for non-radiative losses or even device degradation. Halogenation of OPV materials has long been employed to tailor energy levels and to enhance open circuit voltage. Yet, the influence on recombination to triplet excitons has been largely unexplored. Using the complementary spin-sensitive methods of photoluminescence detected magnetic resonance and transient electron paramagnetic resonance corroborated by transient absorption and quantum-chemical calculations, exciton pathways in OPV blends are unravelled employing the polymer donors PBDB-T, PM6, and PM7 together with NFAs Y6 and Y7. All blends reveal triplet excitons on the NFA populated via non-geminate hole back transfer and, in blends with halogenated donors, also by spin-orbit coupling driven intersystem crossing. Identifying these triplet formation pathways in all tested solar cell absorber films highlights the untapped potential for improved charge generation to further increase plateauing OPV efficiencies.},

abstract = {Three structurally different low molecular weight diketopyrrolopyrroles (DPPs) are synthesized in order to provide donors with a precise offset in their energy levels. The DPPs are characterized for optical, electrochemical, and thermal properties. By changing the terminal aryl groups attached to the DPP core from phenyl over m-pyridine to p-pyridine, different solid state packing is observed in thin film studies using UV/VIS absorption spectra and X-ray diffraction. Most importantly it is shown that both, reduction as well as oxidation potentials can be precisely tuned with a gradual stepping of about 100 meV by changing the terminal groups attached to the DPP core. Exploiting this energy level modification, these materials are tested in planar cascade organic photovoltaic devices using C60 as acceptor. A sub nm thick interlayer of a suitable DPP derivative is introduced to obtain a distinct energy level cascade at the donor/acceptor interface. Power conversion efficiency as well as short-circuit current density is doubled with respect to the reference bilayer devices lacking the interface cascade. Spectrally resolved analysis of external quantum efficiency reveals that this enhancement can mainly be attributed to destabilization of bound charge transfer states formed in the C60 layer at the interlayer interface, thus reducing geminate recombination losses.},

abstract = {Abstract Weak reflectivity of carbon-electrode (CE) limits light harvesting of perovskite solar cells that are based on CEs (CPSCs), especially for long-wavelength region. To solve this problem, herein the crystallization of perovskite (PVSK) is regulated by tuning the concentration of PbI2 precursor during the two-step growth method. As concentration increases from 1.0 to 1.7 mol L−1, film thickness of PVSK rises from ≈360 to ≈850 nm, and the average grain/crystallite size of PVSK enlarges from 0.70 to 1.14 µm, and from 54.2 to 67.5 nm, respectively. Due to the upgraded crystallization, Urbach energy drops from 98 to 41 meV, lifetime of charge carriers increases obviously, meanwhile the light harvesting of PVSK is improved during the long-wavelength regions (600–810 nm). External quantum efficiency test on the CPSCs shows that the integrated short circuit current density (JSC) increases by 15.6\% during the long-wavelength region. Accordingly, JSC improves from 20.27 (±0.36) to 22.58 (±0.27) mA cm−2. Besides, leakage is retarded, and open-circuit voltage is improved. These merits help elevate the power conversion efficiency from 15.37 (±0.42) to 16.37 (±0.68) \% (optimized at 17.69\%). Prolonging spin-time of PbI2 further improves PVSK crystallization and light harvest, which optimizes device efficiency to 19.17\%.},

Devices using a standard CdS buffer exhibit a strong anticorrelation between the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC), with VOC decreasing and JSC increasing toward stoichiometric absorber composition. Increasing the ACGS deposition temperature leads to larger grains and improved JSC, while VOC is not affected. By adding more silver to the absorber (maximum tested [Ag]/([Ag]+[Cu]) [AAC] = 0.4), the widening of the space charge region (SCR) significantly enhances carrier collection. Experimental quantum efficiency spectra can be accurately simulated when assuming a very low diffusion length and perfect collection in the SCR. The highest efficiency of 8.3\% (without antireflection coating [ARC]) is reached for an absorber with AAC = 0.4 grown at 600 °C. Replacing CdS by a (Zn,Sn)O buffer with lower electron affinity strongly mitigates interface recombination. Moreover, the VOC–JSC anticorrelation is not evident anymore and the highest efficiency of 11.2\% (11.6\% w/ARC, VOC = 985 mV, JSC = 18.6 mA cm−2, fill factor = 61.0\%) is reached for a close-stoichiometric ACGS solar cell with AAC = 0.4 processed at 650 °C.},

Conversely, due to its antisymmetric character, CD cannot be directly applied to the matrix representation of the spatial part of the two-electron spin-orbit coupling (2e-SOC) integrals. Here, we present a computational strategy to achieve a Cholesky representation of the spatial part of the 2e-SOC integrals, and propose a new efficient CD algorithm for both ERI and 2e-SOC integrals. The proposed algorithm differs from previous CD implementations by the extensive use of a full-pivoting design, which allows a univocal definition of the Cholesky basis, once the CD δ threshold is made explicit. We show that is the upper limit for the errors affecting the reconstructed 2e-SOC integrals.

The problem is formulated as a dynamic program that aims to adjust consumer needs for electricity charges and comfort flexibly. Moreover, the Monte Carlo method is used to imitate the environmental uncertainties due to predicted outdoor temperatures. To determine the day-ahead temperature schedules for air-conditioning loads, a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization based on space compression strategy (QPSO-SC) is presented in this paper. Space compression and particle re-initialization by chaotic initialization enhance the performance of the QPSO-SC. Finally, we test the proposed method for the TOU and demand pricing plan from Duke Energy. Thermostatical, daily energy charge saving, and monthly charge saving strategies are first compared, and the QPSO-SC is further compared with the particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, differential evolution, and other optimization algorithms. From the extensive simulations, the QPSO-SC is observed to be capable of yielding higher-quality solutions stably and efficiently than the other optimization algorithms; the proposed optimal strategy can also achieve a better balance between electricity charge and customer comfort, considering environmental uncertainties.},

In search of high-speed computing in the nano-scale era, it becomes the utmost necessity to explore a viable alternative to overcome the challenges of the physical limit of complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS). Towards that direction, the processing-in-memory (PIM) is advancing its importance as it keeps the computation as adjacent as possible to memory. It promises to outperform the latencies of the conventional stored-program concept by embedding storage and data computation in a single unit.

Again, quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) emerges as a promising nanoelectronic to put back CMOS to give fast-paced devices at the nanoelectronics era.

QCA implementation of universal logic utilizing Akers array signifies its processing power and puts forth its potentials.

To accomplish neuromorphic computing, highly efficient optoelectronic synapses, which can be the building blocks of optoelectronic neuromorphic computers, are necessary. Currently, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), an attractive candidate to develop circuit-level photonic synapses, provide weak light responses. The inferior photoresponse of CNTs increases the energy consumption of neuromorphic optoelectronic devices. Herein, a method to grow organic–inorganic halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) directly on multiwall CNTs (MWCNTs) to increase the photosensitivity of optoelectronic synapses is demonstrated. The new hybrid material synchronizes the high photoresponse of PQDs and the excellent electrical properties of MWCNTs to provide photonic memory under very low light intensity (125 µW cm−2). However, neat MWCNTs do not show any detectable light response at the tested light intensity, as high as 25 mW cm−2. Since the PQDs are grown directly on and in the MWCNTs, the hybrid PQD-MWCNT provides a new direction for the future MWCNT-based optoelectronic devices for neuromorphic computing with a potential to break the von Neumann bottleneck.},

It can still be used as an absorber top layer in tandem photovoltaic cells by forming two new, promising materials, Cd1–xZnxTe (CZT) and Cd1–xMnxTe (CMT). Consequently, CZT and CMT based PV cells have been explored, and an attempt has been made to provide an alternative to cadmuim telluride. After exploring the physical properties of CZT and CMT thin films, CZT and CMT based photovoltaic cells were fabricated using the vacuum evaporation method. Both devices (with low absorber layer thickness, 1.05 µm) showed a power conversion efficiency of 6.67\% and 6.11\%, respectively. The depletion layer width and dopant densities of both photovoltaic cells were also determined by capacitance–voltage measurements. The quantum efficiencies were measured to identify the specific losses that are causing the measured short circuit current density to deviate from its ideal value.

For the effective transfer of a huge amount of data between arithmetic and storage devices, optical communication technology represents a compelling solution. Here, by replicating a floating gate architecture with CdSe/ZnS type-I core/shell quantum dots (QDs), a 2D–0D hybrid optical multi-level memory (OMM) device operated is demonstrated by laser pulses. In the device, laser pulses create linear optically trapped currents with MM characteristics, while conversely, voltage pulses reset all the trapped currents at once. Assuming electron transfer via the energy band alignment between MoS2 and CdSe, the study also establishes the mechanism of the OMM effect. Analysis of the designed device led to a new hypothesis that charge transfer is difficult for laterally adjacent QDs facing a double ZnS shell, which is tested by separately stimulating different positions on the 2D–0D hybrid structure with finely focused laser pulses. Results indicate that each laser pulse induced independent MM characteristics in the 2D–0D hybrid architecture. Based on this phenomenon, we propose a MM inverter to produce MM effects, such as programming and erasing, solely through the use of laser pulses. Finally, the feasibility of a fully optically-controlled intelligent system based on the proposed OMM inverters is evaluated through a CIFAR-10 pattern recognition task using a convolutional neural network.},

abstract = {Reducing the production cost of highly efficient silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells is essential for their large-scale commercialization. Replacing screen printed silver contacts with plated copper is an effective way. However, one needs to deal with the process compatibility without sacrificing the cell performance. In this work, a layer stack of silicon oxide and silicon nitride (SiOx/SiNx) is proposed, serving dual functions of light-trapping and selective copper plating mask. The SiOx/SiNx stack is prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) on a tungsten doped indium oxide (IWO) layer. Optimized SiOx/SiNx/IWO stacks in SHJ solar cells with silver contacts result in excellent anti-reflection properties and improved external quantum efficiency. A short circuit current density gain of 1.16 mA cm−2 is achieved without the loss in fill factor. This SiOx/SiNx stack is tested as in-situ deposited selective plating mask for a front-side copper plating process. An in-house made light induced plating tool is utilized. A screen printed silver finger is applied as a seed layer for copper plating. The bulk resistivity of Cu/Ag finger reduces to 4.1 E-6 Ω · cm, which is lower than that of low temperature silver paste (around 6 E-6 Ω · cm) before copper is plated on it. The dual functions of SiOx/SiNx stack and the process are proven, indicating a good potential for further improving photoelectric properties of SHJ solar cells after well optimization.},

abstract = {Abstract We present a new assessment of the Fermi-Löwdin orbital self-interaction correction (FLO-SIC) approach with an emphasis on its performance for predicting energies as a function of fractional occupation numbers (FONs) for various multielectron systems. Our approach is implemented in the massively parallelized NWChem quantum chemistry software package and has been benchmarked on the prediction of total energies, atomization energies, and ionization potentials of small molecules and relatively large aromatic systems. Within our study, we also derive an alternate expression for the FLO-SIC energy gradient expressed in terms of gradients of the Fermi-orbital eigenvalues and revisit how the FLO-SIC methodology can be seen as a constrained unitary transformation of the canonical Kohn–Sham orbitals. Finally, we conclude with calculations of energies as a function of FONs using various SIC-scaling methods to test the limits of the FLO-SIC formalism on a variety of multielectron systems. We find that these relatively simple scaling methods do improve the prediction of total energies of atomic systems as well as enhance the accuracy of energies as a function of FONs for other multielectron chemical species.},

abstract = {The growth of world population has fueled environmental, legal, and social concerns, making governments and companies attempt to mitigate the environmental and social implications stemming from supply chain operations. The state-run Environmental Protection Agency has initially offered financial incentives (subsidies) meant to encourage supply chain managers to use cleaner technologies in order to minimize pollution. In today’s competitive markets, using green technologies remains vital. In the present project, we have examined a class of closed-loop supply chain competitive facility location-routing problems. According to the framework of the competition, one of the players, called the Leader, opens its facilities first. The second player, called the Follower, makes its decision when Leader’s location is known. Afterwards, each customer chooses an open facility based on some preference huff rules before returning the benefits to one of the two companies. The follower, under the influence of the leader’s decisions, performs the best reaction in order to obtain the maximum capture of the market. So, a bilevel mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated. The objective function at both levels includes market capture profit, fixed and operating costs, and financial incentives. A metaheuristic quantum binary particle swarm optimization (PSO) is developed via Benders decomposition algorithm to solve the proposed model. To evaluate the convergence rate and solution quality, the method is applied to some random test instances generated in the literature. The computational results indicate that the proposed method is capable of efficiently solving the model.},

Moreover, the structural properties of the mixed ligand complexes were investigated using mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. These complexes are expected to have octahedral molecular geometry depending on the electronic spectra and magnetic susceptibility tests. The two mixed ligands (L1L2) are bivalent ligands with two oxygen atoms. As an example, the quantum chemical properties, bond lengths, and bond angles were discussed for the Cu(II) complex. The Gaussian09 program was used to optimize the structural formula for the investigated ligand. The energy gaps and other essential theoretical properties were calculated using the DFT/B3LYP approach. The prepared mixed ligand complexes 3 a, 3 b, and 3 c were evaluated for their antibacterial properties. These complexes were tested against both Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) using the agar diffusion method. The organic ligands were observed to be less biologically active than the targeted complexes as antimicrobial agents. According to molecular docking, the title compounds have a positive interaction with the crystal structures of Escherichia coli (3HUM), Staphylococcus aureus (5 M18), Bacillus subtilis (5ZW4), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4WEL).},

abstract = {Abstract Highly sensitive shortwave infrared (SWIR) detectors are essential for detecting weak radiation (typically below 10−8 W·Sr−1·cm−2·µm−1) with high-end passive image sensors. However, mainstream SWIR detection based on epitaxial photodiodes cannot effectively detect ultraweak infrared radiation due to the lack of inherent gain. Here, we develop a heterojunction-gated field-effect transistor (HGFET) consisting of a colloidal quantum dot (CQD)-based p-i-n heterojunction and a carbon nanotube (CNT) field-effect transistor, which achieves a high inherent gain based on an opto-electric decoupling mechanism for suppressing noise. The stacked heterojunction absorbs infrared radiation and separates electron–hole pairs. Then, the generated photovoltage tunes the drain current of the CNT FET through an Y2O3 gate insulator. As a result, the HGFET significantly detects and amplifies SWIR signals with a high inherent gain while minimally amplifying noise, leading to a recorded specific detectivity above 1014 Jones at 1300 nm and a recorded maximum gain-bandwidth product of 69.2 THz. Direct comparative testing indicates that the HGFET can detect weak infrared radiation at 0.46 nW cm−2 levels; thus, compared to commercial and reported SWIR detectors, this detector is much more sensitive and enables starlight detection or vision. As the fabrication process is very compatible with CMOS readout integrated circuits, the HGFET is a promising SWIR detector for realizing passive night vision imaging sensors with high resolutions that are high-end, highly sensitive, and inexpensive.},

Compared to some of the most popular commercial probes, our probes possess several advantages: 1) they utilize the increasingly available but little used 405 nm laser for excitation yet due to a large Stokes shift can be visualized with green filter sets such as those used with GFP, 2) they equilibrate rapidly (seconds to minutes) with target organelles and respond rapidly to changing conditions such as mitochondrial depolarization, 3) they are extremely chemically stable and photostable allowing long-term monitoring of live cell organelles and 3D confocal imaging as well as having a long shelf life, 4) they have low toxicity toward mammalian and fungal cells and, 5) they have high quantum yields with little self quenching allowing for quantitative and qualitative imaging in complete culture media with minimal interference from background and autofluorescence. These probes have the potential to be very useful in long-term microscopic cell biology studies and other methods using live cells such as flow cytometry.

abstract = {Abstract A round-robin proficiency test (RR PT) on thin-film multi-junction (MJ) photovoltaic (PV) cells was run between 13 laboratories within the European project CHEETAH. Five encapsulated PV cells were circulated to participants for being tested at Standard Test Conditions (STC). Three cells were a-Si/μc-Si tandem PV devices, each of which had a different short-circuit current ratio between the top junction and the bottom one; the remaining two cells were single-junction PV devices made with material representative of the individual junctions in the MJ cells. The RR PT's main purpose was to assess the capability of the participating laboratories, in terms of employed facilities and procedures, to test MJ PV devices. Therefore, participants were requested to perform STC measurements of all cells according to their own procedure, which might not include external quantum efficiency measurements. The European Solar Test Installation (ESTI) of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) provided the reference calibrations against which the participants' results are compared. ESTI made also a verification of the cells performance at STC at the end of the RR PT, in order to allow a comparison between the initial stable state at which the cells were calibrated (just before circulation) and the one they had reached at the end of the RR PT. The overall results of the RR PT are here presented and discussed together with some aspects of MJ PV testing that emerged as not adequately applied or largely missing. Their full implementation is expected to improve the consistency of future results.},

abstract = {Abstract Potential induced degradation (PID) has been affecting the performance, durability, and reliability of crystalline Si solar cells/modules. The authors demonstrate that micro-cracks also act as the additional recombination centers, which reduce short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and the effective lifetime of carriers in solar cells, in PID condition. This hypothesis was confirmed by external quantum efficiency measurements and microwave photo-conductance decay method at the micro-cracked areas before and after PID stress tests. In addition, the PID recovery was made significantly but non-fully for the laminated micro-cracked modules owing to the electrical PID recovery method. In addition, the authors showed and discussed the challenging problems in recovering the performance of the PID-affected micro-cracked solar modules without lamination. The achieved results from 11 cycles of PID stress/recovery tests with the same duration of PID stress and recovery processes showed that an exponentially decreasing function fits the correlation between the relative losses of Pmax, Voc, fill factor (FF), and Jsc due to the PID stress process and the number of the PID stress/recovery cycles. This provides a model for the estimation of the relative losses of Pmax, Voc, FF, and Jsc due to the PID stress process versus the number of the PID stress/recovery cycles. Finally, based on the decreasing tendency in the performance loss of the PID-affected laminated micro-cracked solar modules after PID stress/recovery cycles, the authors suggest that cyclic PID tests with suitable conditions might be a reasonable approach to control PID.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Establishing regulatory limits for Drug Substance-Related Impurities (NDSRIs) is challenging due to the limited genotoxicity and carcinogenicity data available for many of these impurities, often leading to conservative approaches. In this study, we evaluated the genotoxic potential of two structurally related nitrosamines: N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) and N-nitroso reboxetine. Compared to the well-studied NMOR, there is little toxicological information available for N-nitroso reboxetine. Currently, both compounds have an acceptable intake value of 127 ng/day, based on a read-across using the available carcinogenicity data of NMOR. While both compounds tested positive in a series of in vitro and in vivo assays, we found that the mutagenic potential of N-nitroso reboxetine was significantly lower than that of NMOR. The benchmark dose (BMD) analysis of in vivo mutagenicity data supports an acceptable intake of 24,000 ng/day for N-nitroso reboxetine. Computational studies, carried out using the quantum-mechanical CADRE program, were consistent with in vitro and in vivo outcomes, suggesting an acceptable intake at or above 1500 ng/day for N-nitroso reboxetine. In comparison to NMOR, this prediction is supported by lower computed reactivity in the hydroxylation step, greater steric hindrance of the alpha carbons, and more facile proton transfer in the heterolysis toward the aldehyde metabolite. The data presented in this work can be used to refine and improve the Carcinogenic Potency Categorization Approach (CPCA). It also underscores the importance of collaboration between regulatory authorities, the pharmaceutical industry, and scientific researchers to address potential risks while avoiding overestimation of the acceptable intake limits for certain NDSRIs.},

abstract = {Abstract Accelerated tests were used to study potential-induced degradation (PID) in photovoltaic (PV) modules fabricated from silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells containing tungsten-doped indium oxide (IWO) transparent conductive films on both sides of the cells and a rear-side emitter. A negative bias of −1000 V was applied to a module with respect to the cover glass surface in a chamber maintained at 85°C, which significantly reduced the cell's short-circuit current density (Jsc) within several days. Based on dark current density-voltage and external quantum efficiency measurements, the reduction in the Jsc was attributed to optical losses rather than carrier recombination. X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy showed the formation of metallic indium (In) in the IWO layers of a degraded cell, which suggests that the root cause of the optical loss was a darkening of the front IWO layers caused by the precipitation of metallic In. In extremely severe PID tests, the SHJ PV modules exhibited not only a further reduction in the Jsc but also a moderate reduction in the open-circuit voltage (Voc). These Jsc and Voc reductions were probably caused by sodium being introduced into the base region of the cells. A comparison of the PID test results of the SHJ PV modules with those of other types of PV modules indicates that SHJ PV modules have a relatively high resistance to PID. As a module with an ionomer encapsulant exhibited little degradation, their high resistances to PID may be further improved by using encapsulants with high electrical resistances.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Acceptable intake (AI) limits for nitrosamine drug substance related impurities (NDSRIs) that lack carcinogenicity data could be estimated from mutagenic potency relative to anchor nitrosamines with carcinogenicity data. This approach integrates points of departure (PoDs) derived from in vivo mutagenicity studies with in silico predictions generated by a validated quantum-mechanical (QM) model. N-nitrosodiethanolamine (NDELA) and N-nitrosopiperidine (NPIP), with AIs derived from robust carcinogenicity data, were tested in the transgenic rodent (TGR) gene mutation assay. Liver mutant frequency and benchmark dose (BMD) modeling provided a suitable, robust, and precise PoD metric. BMD confidence intervals (CIs) calculated from mutant frequency expanded the potency range of previously reported BMD CIs for other anchor nitrosamines. Cancer-protective AIs for mutagenic NDSRIs can be pragmatically calculated on a potency basis by comparing their lower bound TGR BMD CIs with the BMD CIs and AIs derived from model/anchor nitrosamines that have results for in vivo gene mutation and cancer bioassays. In vivo modeling was supported by the Computer-Aided Discovery and RE-design (CADRE) program, a validated QM model for predicting NDSRI carcinogenic potency based on the underlying mechanism of mutagenicity. CADRE distinguished between anchor nitrosamines N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and the less potent NDELA and NPIP. Scrutiny of underlying reactivity indices and relevant physicochemical properties rationalized the observed trend in metabolic activity and thus predicted carcinogenic potency. Leveraging the in vivo–in silico approach is valuable in gaining confidence in the proposed AIs, whereby the QM model serves as mechanistic validation of in vivo results.},

The DSSC, based on a mesoporous TiO2 photoanode co-sensitized with SM315 and ZnTPP dyes, harvests light from 400 to 650 nm. The bottom cell, using a Cs/FA/MA mixed-halide perovskite, targets near-infrared photons (650–850 nm). A dielectric multilayer optical filter facilitates spectral splitting, while a thin indium tin oxide recombination layer ensures efficient series connection and current matching. Under calibrated dual-LED illumination (∼125 mW/cm2), the tandem achieved a lab-measured power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 33.7\%, with a simulated maximum of ∼36.8\% and an average reproducible PCE of 33.2\% ± 0.4\% (n = 3). When tested under a class AAA AM1.5G solar simulator (100 mW/cm2), the device produced a baseline PCE of 27.1\% (short-circuit current density, JSC = 16.1 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage, VOC = 1.95 V, fill factor, FF = 0.72). These values are in-house laboratory results, not certified records. UV–Vis, FTIR, external quantum efficiency, and EIS confirmed effective charge transport and spectral complementarity. Surface and interface morphology were characterized by AFM, SEM, and HRTEM. Stability testing showed > 96\% retention after 500 h at 25°C and ∼86\% at 60°C. Outdoor field testing under tropical weather confirmed functional robustness. This scalable, solution-processed tandem architecture shows promise for next-generation photovoltaics, including building-integrated and indoor energy applications.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper elucidates the behavior and underlying mechanism of potential-induced degradation (PID) on the rear side of p-type monocrystalline silicon bifacial passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) photovoltaic modules. At 50°C, 30\% relative humidity, and −1000 V bias to the solar cells with aluminium foil on the rear glass surface, the rear-side performance of bifacial PERC modules at standard testing conditions degraded dramatically after 40 hours with a 40.4\%, 36.2\%, and 7.2\% loss in maximum power (Pmpp), short-circuit current (Isc), and open-circuit voltage (Voc), respectively. The front-side standard testing condition performance, on the other hand, showed less degradation; Pmpp, Isc, and Voc dropped by 12.0\%, 5.2\%, and 5.3\%, respectively. However, negligible degradation was observed when the solar cells were positively biased. Based on I-V characteristics, electroluminescence, external quantum efficiency measurements, and the effective minority-carrier lifetime simulation, the efficiency loss is shown to be caused by the surface polarization effect; positive charges are attracted to the passivation/antireflection stack on the rear surface and reduce its field effect passivation performance. Extended PID testing to 100 hours showed an increase in device performances (relative to 40 hours) due to the formation of an inversion layer along the rear surface. In addition, replacing ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer with polyolefin elastomer films significantly slows down the progression of PID, whereas a glass/transparent backsheet design effectively protects the rear side of bifacial PERC modules from PID. Furthermore, PID on the rear side of bifacial PERC modules is fully recoverable, and light greatly promotes recovery of the observed PID.},

abstract = {Abstract Combinatorial testing (CT) can efficiently detect failures caused by interactions of parameters of software under test. The CT study has undergone a transition from traditional CT to constrained CT, which is crucial for real-world systems testing. Under this scenario, constrained covering array generation (CCAG), a vital combinatorial optimisation issue targeted with constructing a test suite of minimal size while properly addressing constraints, remains challenging in CT. To the authors’ best knowledge, this paper presents a synergic method first based on quantum particle swarm optimisation (QPSO) for the CCAG problems. Three auxiliary strategies, including contraction-expansion coefficient adaptive change strategy, differential evolution strategy, and discretisation strategy, are proposed to improve the performance of QPSO. Meanwhile, the improved QPSO method combines with the three different constraint handling strategies and an enhanced one-test-at-a-time strategy as a synergic QPSO method named QPIO to solve the CCAG problem. In the experiment, we investigate the impacts of parameter settings on the performance of the QPIO. Extensive experimental results show that the QPIO algorithm is a competitive method compared to the representative methods for CCAG. Besides, the QPIO method enriches the application of the QPSO algorithm in the context of CT.},

abstract = {Nano hexagon NiCeO2 is synthesized via a simple one-pot hydrothermal method and evaluated as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an Al-air battery (AAB). Structural analysis using X-ray diffraction reveals peak shifts and lattice contraction, confirming the successful incorporation of Ni into the CeO2 host matrix. Raman spectroscopy identified a characteristic peak associated with oxygen vacancies, indicating defect formation. Thermogravimetric analysis showed a 4.97\% weight gain, likely due to the filling of oxygen vacancies at elevated temperatures. Transmission electron microscope revealed a nano hexagon morphology with an average particle size of 20 nm. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy analysis confirmed the presence of both cerium and nickel elements. Electronic structure calculations, performed using density functional theory via Quantum ESPRESSO, indicated that Ni doping introduces new 3d states into the CeO2 band structure, resulting in bandgap narrowing and a lowered Fermi level. Electrochemical testing demonstrated that NiCeO2 exhibits superior ORR performance compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts. Kinetic analysis suggested a near four-electron transfer pathway. Durability is assessed using chronoamperometry, showing that NiCeO2 retained 90\% of its initial current after 20 h of operation, outperforming Pt/C. Furthermore, an AAB is constructed using NiCeO2 as the cathode, which achieved an open circuit voltage of 1.65 V with a discharge capacity of 1070 mAh·g−1, delivering a notable power density of 77.64 mW·cm−2. The enhanced ORR activity is attributed to the synergistic interaction between CeO2 and Ni, which significantly improves the overall performance of the AAB These findings suggest that NiCeO2 is a promising cathode material for high-performance AABs.}

Through meticulous adjustments in material compositions and device architectures, optimization enhances energy conversion efficiency, making solar power more competitive and adaptable across various applications. This article presents the optimization and efficiency enhancement of a ZnO/CdS/CIGS solar cell with GaAs. The optimization process utilizes the particle swarm optimization algorithm with a step-by-step approach. Solar cells are designed using SCAPS-1D software, and optimization is performed using Python. The optimized ZnO/CdS/CIGS solar cell achieves an efficiency of 32.4\%, which rises to 44.7\% upon integrating a GaAs layer. Further efficiency gains are observed, reaching 53.2\% through back contact optimization, providing a power density of 54 mW cm−2. Optimization also notices a significant improvement in quantum efficiency. The cells are tested under concentrated solar irradiance (1000–10 000 W m−2) and temperatures (300–800 K). Results show that at 10 000 W m−2 and 800 K, the ZnO/CdS/CIGS/GaAs cell requires 53.9\% less material than the ZnO/CdS/CIGS cell. Thus, adding GaAs enhances efficiency and thermal resilience, making it ideal for concentrated photovoltaics.},

Models describing bifurcating phenomena arising in several fields with interesting applications, from continuum to quantum mechanics passing through fluid dynamics [2–4]. Following the approach in [5], we analyzed different bifurcating test cases where both physical and geometrical parameters were considered. In particular, we studied the Navier-Stokes equations for a viscous, steady and incompressible flow in a planar straight channel with a narrow inlet. We reconstructed the branching solutions and explored a new empirical strategy in order to employ the RB and ANN for an efficient detection of the critical points. All the simulations were performed within the open source software FEniCS and RBniCS for the ROM, while we chose PyTorch to construct the neural network.},

The scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that the ligand and its metal chelates exist in stick crystallized structures and sizes of their molecules can exist in nanoform. Thermal analyses techniques (TG and DTA) measured the investigated chelates during their thermal degradation to elucidate their structures. It was proved that ligand (L) acts as bibasic bidentate ligand coordinating to metal cations via its two oxygen atoms of carbonyl and epoxy groups. The optimization of the structural formula for the examined ligand had been performed by using Gaussian 09 program. The energy gaps were calculated using the DFT/B3LYP method. The ligand and its chelates had been fixed to have consistent bond lengths and bond angles that proved via quantum chemical factors. The ligand (L) and its transition metal chelates had been tested for their antibacterial activities. In vitro biological properties for ligand (L) and its transition metal complexes were carried out against Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) by agar diffusion technique. The results showed that title compounds are biologically active than the parent ligand in their sticks crystalline and possible nanostructures and consequently large surface interactions.

abstract = {Abstract This paper describes the development of superconductor–insulator–superconductor (SIS) receivers in the 787–950 GHz radio frequency (RF) range, which covers the highest frequency band of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and is recognized as the most difficult band in terms of superconducting technology, because the conventional superconducting material of Nb cannot be used for the circuitry in the mixer devices at the frequencies. The development began at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) in 2005, and the manufacturing and testing of all the receivers to be installed in the 66 Cassegrain reflector antennas that compose ALMA was completed in 2013. This enabled the terahertz frequency observations with the highest sensitivity from the ground. To meet the stringent ALMA requirements, terahertz SIS mixers with high-quality superconducting NbTiN films were developed, which successfully demonstrated an unpreceded noise performance less than 230 K (5 times the quantum noise) for all the receivers. After the construction of ALMA, NAOJ began development studies for ALMA enhancement such as wideband and multibeam SIS receivers according to top-level science requirements. To increase instantaneous bandwidth of the receivers, a submillimeter-wave multiband receiver concept with a waveguide multiplexer, wideband intermediate frequency SIS-mixer-amplifier, and multifrequency local oscillator (LO) source is presented. The multibeam receiver employs a planar-integrated SIS mixer circuit that includes all the RF components except the LO distribution network and an SIS-mixer-based amplifier of low power consumption, which is expected to enable the wide field-of-view observations in the future.},

abstract = {Summary Solar-powered devices, such as wireless networks, are a crucial component of the Internet of Things (IoT). Designing and creating a solar cell architecture with an extended light absorption regime at a reasonable cost is therefore exceedingly important. All inorganic bismuth-based Cs2AgBiI6 planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered enormous significance due to their exceptional stability against oxygen, heat, and moisture. However, the power conversion efficiencies of Cs2AgBiI6-based planar PSCs remain relatively low, primarily due to their limited light absorption range and interfacial charge recombination losses. This issue can be effectively addressed using a novel multi-absorber architecture that incorporates dual absorbers with both lower band gap and wider band gap materials. This approach extends the light absorption range, enabling maximal utilization of the solar spectrum. Therefore, this article incorporates numerical modeling and guided optimization of ITO/ETL/Cs2AgBiI6/Fa0.75Cs0.25SnI3/HTL/Ag dual absorber-based heterojunction structure to improvise the power conversion efficiency of Cs2AgBiI6-based single-absorber PSCs. The proposed configuration employs dual perovskite absorber layers (PALs) consisting of wide band gap Cs2AgBiI6 (1.6 eV) as the top absorber layer along with narrow bandgap Fa0.75Cs0.25SnI3 (1.27 eV) to act as the bottom absorber layer. Before evaluating the bilayer configuration, two standalone PSC architectures, namely, ITO/ETL/Fa0.75Cs0.25SnI3/HTL/Ag (D1)- and ITO/ETL/Cs2AgBiI6/HTL/Ag (D2)-based PSC have been simulated and computed to perfectly fit the earlier anticipated state of art results. After effective validation of the photovoltaic parameters of the standalone architectures, both the absorber layers are appraised to constitute a dual active layer configuration ITO/ETL/Cs2AgBiI6/Fa0.75Cs0.25SnI3/HTL/Ag (D3) maintaining the overall absorber layer width constant to elevate the overall solar cell efficiency. Herein, a combination of various competent hole transport layers (HTLs) such as CBTS, CFTS, Cu2O, CuI, CuO, CuSCN, P3HT, PEDOT:PSS, and Spiro-OMeTAD, as well as electron transport layers (ETLs) like C60, CeO2, IgZo, PCBM, TiO2, WS2, and ZnO, are adopted and compared to attain highly efficient bilayer PSC configuration. The crucial variables of all ETL- and HTL-based proposed bilayer solar cell configurations including the thickness of PALs, the width of the carrier transport layers, defect densities of transport layers, the effect of operating temperature, series, and shunt resistances have been extensively optimized and tuned to attain preeminent photovoltaic power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and quantum efficiencies (QEs). It has been well evinced that the proposed configuration with dual-absorber layers could effectively widen the light absorption regime to the near-infrared range and thus significantly contribute toward enhanced photovoltaic performance. The simulation results attained with SCAPS showcase the outstanding performance of the proposed dual active layer solar structure obtained with the combination of CuSCN HTL and TiO2 ETL pair. The work concludes a 35.01\% optimized efficient ITO/TiO2/Cs2AgBiI6(PAL-2)/Fa0.75Cs0.25SnI3(PAL-1)/CuSCN/Ag bilayer solar cell configuration with enhanced short circuit current density (Jsc) of 32.24 mA/cm2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.273 V, and 85.31\% fill factor (FF) with 0.6- and 0.8-μm PAL-1 and PAL-2 width respectively and 1014-cm−3 defect density under AM1.G solar spectrum illumination with 1000-W/m2 light power density. The proposed eco-friendly solar structure will also help in providing power backup to the next-generation communication units and devices. Notably the dual-absorber structure integrating Cs2AgBiI6 and Fa0.75Cs0.25SnI3 materials demonstrates significant advantages in quantum efficiency and spectral coverage compared to using either material independently as single absorbers. The proposed model achieves a peak efficiency of approximately 93\% across a spectral range of 300–975 nm, surpassing the 90\% efficiency obtained with a single Cs2AgBiI6 absorber covering 300–700 nm. Moreover, it exceeds the 89\% efficiency achieved by the single Fa0.75Cs0.25SnI3 absorber within the 300- to 974.5-nm spectral range. Solar cells play a pivotal role in ensuring the sustainability, reliability, and cost efficiency of powering wireless nodes, especially in remote or environmentally sensitive areas where traditional power sources may be inadequate or unavailable. The proposed PSC, with a PCE of 35.01\%, can generate 350.1 watts under standard test conditions. This provides sufficient power to support approximately 70 wireless nodes, including wireless sensor nodes, IoT devices, and others, each consuming approximately 5 watts of power.},

abstract = {Viruses can infect the host's cell through different mechanisms. Nevertheless, studies have shown that the viral entry pathway more common of viruses that affect humans is the interaction between glycoproteins of the envelope with receptors in the host's cell membrane. For many years, studies have tried to use fluorescent proteins to understand the mechanisms of a single viral particle, but it has not been effective because in order to emit fluorescence, strong enough to be detected, the viral particle must have many of the fluorescent proteins attached and these can alter the invasion of the host cell. Additionally, some do not have an envelope, and therefore for these types of viruses, the fluorescent proteins are not effective. To solve this problem, we are substituting fluorescent proteins for quantum dots (QDs). These QDs are made from different inorganic compounds that have shown to produce more fluorescence than the protein without requiring the use of many of them. This means that these QDs can help study the mechanisms of infection of a single viral particle. These particles are unstable in aqueous solution, and it can cause the production of toxic molecules for the cell. This obstacle has led new research in how one can modify the synthesis or the compound to make a more stable and effective QDs. In this research, we used a proposed protocol for the synthesis of QDs in a direct aqueous solution to obtain a more stable particle. Additionally, to make the QDs more stable for biological applications, we conjugated glutathione (GSH) to these particles. The GSH allowed the QDs to enter the cell and interact with the genome of the virus used for this study, the minute virus of mice (MVMp). Furthermore, we used the cell line MDA-MB-231 as a model to test our experimental approach. This study will help better understand the mechanisms of infection of a single MVMp particle. Additionally, it will open doors to study how this particle can be conjugated with other molecules such as DNA and encapsulated for gene therapy of different diseases.

abstract = {ABSTRACT A recent trend in commercial PV modules is a transition to n-type silicon cells, including passivated emitter rear totally diffused (n-PERT), tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon), and silicon heterojunction (SHJ). There is evidence via lab studies that some of these cells are more susceptible to UV induced degradation (UVID), yet there is a lack of confirmation that such degradation occurs in the field. Current IEC standards designed to screen for early module failures require only minimal UV exposure (15 kWh/m2 280–400 nm, ~2–3 months equivalent outdoor exposure). Here, we investigate fielded n-PERT silicon (Si) modules from a commercial utility that show power losses of ~2\%/year. We present a comprehensive picture of the physics and chemistry of degradation supported by both module and cell electronic characterization (EL, PL, IV, EQE, and DLIT) and materials-level morphological and chemical analysis (SEM, EDS, XPS, FTIR, and HPLC). All sampled site modules show short circuit current (Isc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) losses when compared to unfielded spares, with the most severely degraded also having losses in fill factor (FF). We identify two different degradation modes contributing to overall power loss: (1) external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements show losses in the blue range of the spectra, indicative of cell surface recombination losses, and (2) variations in high series resistance (Rs) at the cell level that are correlated with compositional differences in cell metallization. Using unfielded spares, we were able to reproduce Voc, Isc, and EQE losses via a minimum UV stress of 67.5 kWh/m2 (280–400 nm), 4.5× the exposure currently required in IEC 61215-2 (MQT 10). Degradation continued with additional UV dosage equivalent to the fielded modules (405 kWh/m2 total), with power loss leveling out at an average of 6.1\%. Subsequent 1000 h of 85\% RH/85°C damp heat testing showed that cells exposed to UV underwent additional severe series resistance degradation, even those without the susceptible paste composition seen in the field, whereas non-UV exposed cells saw little change. We attribute this to higher concentrations of acetic acid generated on the UV exposed area of the module, leading to degradation of the gridline/cell interface and high Rs. This study is unique in that it reproduces field observed utility scale UVID with an accelerated test and supports the need for standards development for longer UV exposure combined with other stress factors to catch materials interplay within a module package.}

abstract = {Abstract This work underlines some important features for the research on metal complexes of Niclosamide as antioxidants and antimicrobial evaluation of some of these compounds as possible therapeutic agents. Niclosamide metal complexes show a significant leap in the study of antibiotic resistance bacteria including Methicillin Resistant S.aureus (MRSA). The synthesized metal complexes of niclosamide in our current innovation are highly effective at eliminating this destructive sort of bacteria. Niclosamide metal complexes were synthesized then characterized by elemental analysis, Infra-Red, electronic spectra, magnetic susceptibility, Mass spectra and ESR spectra of Cu (II) complex to know their geometries and mode of bonding, with stoichiometry, 1 : 1 (M : L). All the Cr(III), Mn(II), Fe(III), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Cd(II) and Hg(II) metal ions complexes were proposed to be with distorted octahedral geometry. Powder X-Ray Diffraction technique is being utilized to further investigation of synthesized Niclosamide metal complexes. Expo2014 software was also employed to solve the structure of these novel complexes which proven the distortion of crystal structure. The TGA and DTA curves were employed to derive the kinetic thermodynamic parameters. The thermal decomposition of the complexes ended with the formation of divalent metal oxide, MO or trivalent, M2O3 as a final product except in case of Hg complex. The results of the antimicrobial activity of tested new metal complexes compounds exhibited potent antibacterial and antifungal activities in comparison to the Niclosamide ligand as reference. Quantum chemical parameters were estimated and provided noticeable values which completely matched with antimicrobial results that [Mn(NIC)(Cl2)(H2O)2] ⋅ 0.4H2O has higher biological activity than ligand and other novel complexes. low concentration value of MIC results by 125 μg/ml for both niclosamide (NIC) complexes [Ni(NIC)(Cl2)(H2O)2] and [Cu(NIC)(Cl2)(H2O)2] ⋅ 2.5H2O with Methicillin Resistant S.aureus (MRSA) genus maybe a valuable data used to produce novel therapeutic agent. Depending on their structure and on the source of the oxidative stress, metal complexes of Niclosamide might act as antioxidants or pro-oxidants.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT A novel heterocyclic thiosemicarbazide ligand, [(Z)-N-(2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)nicotinohydrazide] (H2L), and its Co(II), Cu(II), and Cd(II) metal chelates were synthesized and characterized using a variety of analytical methods, including elemental analysis, FT-IR, UV–Visible spectroscopy, EI-mass, fluorescence spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, and TGA. The structures and geometries of the complexes were determined using these methods as [Co2(H2L)2Cl2(H2O)4]·2H2O, [Cu(H2L)2Cl2(H2O)2]·2H2O, and [Cd(H2L)2Cl2(H2O)2], all having octahedral geometry. The particulate diameters for [Co2(H2L)2Cl2(H2O)4]·2H2O, [Cu(H2L)2Cl2(H2O)2]·2H2O, and [Cd(H2L)2Cl2(H2O)2] were 192.68, 68.48, and 192.74 nm, respectively using Debye–Scherrer equation and FWHM approach. The corresponding FWHM values were 0.0078, 0.0217, and 0.0075, whereas the crystal strain was calculated as (ε) = 0.0018, 0.0056, and 0.0054, and the dislocation density (δ) as 2.69 × 10−5, 2.13 × 10−4, 2.69 × 10−5 Å−2. Quantum chemical calculations for the ligand and its solid metal complexes were carried out utilizing DFT with the DMOL3 module. Furthermore, the optical sensing response of the free ligand H2L to Co(II), Cu(II), and Cd(II) ions was investigated, revealing that the presence of these metal ions enhanced the fluorescence spectra of the ligand. Additionally, the antibacterial effects of these compounds, as well as their cytotoxicity in human cancer cells, were investigated. Compared to its metal complexes, the ligand, H2L exhibits increased antibacterial activity against various bacteria. Tests on HepG-2 and MCF-7 cells were conducted to evaluate the compounds' anticancer efficacy against the standard, Doxorubicin. The ligand, H2L, demonstrated greater cytotoxicity against the HepG-2 cell line than its metal complexes. Docking experiments were conducted to assess the interaction of the ligand and its complexes with HepG-2 (PDB ID: 2OH4) and MCF-7 (PDB ID: 3W2S) cells, using the XP glide technique and Schrödinger suite software.},

abstract = {In order to reduce current leakage and improve electron transfer in solar cells, charge transport layers (CTL), mainly hybrid electron transport layers (h-ETL), are considered as a solution. In this research contribution, computational analysis using SCAPS-1D software is performed to explore the output photovoltaic parameters of a Sb2S3-based solar cell with h-ETL. No theoretical works on this configuration have been previously reported. The main objectives of the present work are to propose a h-ETL with good band alignment with the Sb2S3 absorber, high transparency, and Cd free; to mitigate the instability and cost issues associated with using Spiro-OMeTAD HTL; and to optimize the solar cell. Thus, we calibrated the J-V characteristics and electrical parameters of the FTO/(ZnO/TiO2)/Sb2S3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au solar cell by numerical simulation and compared them with those of the experiment. Subsequently, our simulations show that to replace the TiO2 ETL used in the experiment and to form the h-ETL with ZnO, IGZO is found to be a good candidate. It has better band alignment with the Sb2S3 absorber than TiO2 ETL, which reduces the trap states at the ETL/Sb2S3 interface; it has high transparency due to its wide bandgap; and an intense electric field is generated at the IGZO/Sb2S3 interface, which reduces the recombination phenomenon at this interface. MoO3, MASnBr3, Cu2O, CuI, and CuSCN HTL were also tested to replace the Spiro-OMeTAD HTL. Simulation results show that the cell with MoO3 HTL achieves higher performance due to its high hole mobility and high quantum efficiency in the visible region; it also allows the solar cell to have better thermal stability (TC = −0.32\%/K) than the cell with Spiro-OMeTAD HTL (TC = −0.53\%/K). The parameters that could improve the solar cell efficiency (η) obtained after these substitutions were also optimized. In particular, the parameters of the Sb2S3 absorber layer (thickness, defect density, and doping), ETL and HTL layer thicknesses, h-ETL/Sb2S3 interface defect density, and series and shunt resistances have been optimized. Finally, by combining high performance and thermal stability, the results show that the thermal stability of the solar cell depends on the back contact type; thus, nickel (Ni) was found to combine high performance and better thermal stability among the back contacts investigated. After these improvements, the efficiency of the Sb2S3-based solar cell increased from 5.08\% (JSC = 16.19 mA/cm2, VOC = 0.56 V, and FF = 55.40\%) to 15.43\% (JSC = 18.51 mA/cm2, VOC = 1.11 V, and FF = 74.76\%). This study proposes an approach to optimize the Sb2S3 upper subcell for tandem solar cells.},
