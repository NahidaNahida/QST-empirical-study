83,1,Automatic repair of quantum programs via unitary operation,"Li, Yuechen and Pei, Hanyu and Huang, Linzhi and Yin, Beibei and Cai, Kai-Yuan",2024.0,10.1145/3664604,ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology,https://doi.org/10.1145/3664604,Association for Computing Machinery,"With the continuous advancement of quantum computing (QC), the demand for high-quality quantum programs (QPs) is growing. To avoid program failure, in software engineering, the technology of automatic program repair (APR) employs appropriate patches to remove potential bugs without the intervention of a human. However, the method tailored for repairing defective QPs is still absent. This article proposes, to the best of our knowledge, a new APR method named UnitAR that can repair QPs via unitary operation automatically. Based on the characteristics of superposition and entanglement in QC, the article constructs an algebraic model and adopts a generate-and-validate approach for the repair procedure. Furthermore, the article presents two schemes that can respectively promote the efficiency of generating patches and guarantee the effectiveness of applying patches. For the purpose of evaluating the proposed method, the article selects 29 mutated versions as well as five real-world buggy programs as the objects and introduces two traditional APR approaches GenProg and TBar as baselines. According to the experiments, UnitAR can fix 23 buggy programs, and this method demonstrates the highest efficiency and effectiveness among three APR approaches. Besides, the experimental results further manifest the crucial roles of two constituents involved in the framework of UnitAR.","@article{li2024automatic,

To locate the bug, the quantum program is divided into several segments, and each segment is tested. However, to prepare a quantum state that is input to a segment, it is necessary to execute all the segments ahead of that segment in a quantum computer. This means that the cost of testing each segment depends on its location. We can also locate a buggy segment only if it is confirmed that there are no bugs in all segments ahead of that buggy segment. Since a quantum program is tested statistically on the basis of measurement results, there is a tradeoff between testing accuracy and cost. These characteristics are unique to quantum programs and complicate locating bugs. We propose an efficient bug-locating method consisting of four approaches, i.e., cost-based binary search, early determination, finalization, and looking back, which take these characteristics into account. We present experimental results indicating that the proposed method can reduce bug-locating cost, represented as the number of executed quantum gates, compared with naive methods that do not use the four approaches. The limitations and usefulness of the proposed method are also discussed on the basis of the experimental results.","@article{sato2025bug,

The counter-intuitive behavior of quantum algorithms makes it particularly important to develop practical techniques and tools to support the analysis and quality assurance of quantum programs. For classical programs, software testing is today one of the most effective and easy-to-use quality-assurance techniques. However, many postulates of quantum physics like superposition, entanglement and non-cloneability of qubit states as well as the probabilistic outcome and destructive effects of qubit measurements obstruct any straight-forward adaptation of classical testing techniques to quantum programs. Recent works either treat quantum programs as black-box components with classical interfaces to apply end-to-end testing or shift the focus of quality assurance to formal verification of quantum programs. In this paper, we instead propose a model-based framework for testing quantum computations at the level of execution traces. Our approach is independent of the quantum programming language and hardware used and utilizes probabilistic transition systems as abstract test model for both the specification and implementation to be tested. In our model, we carefully distinguish between controllable and observable as well as between nondeterministic and probabilistic test steps. Our framework makes quantum program testing a partly reactive process that can be complemented by statistical approaches for identifying erroneous qubit states by repeated measurements.

However, the absence of testing methodology restricts their quality. Different input format and operator from traditional program make this issue hard to resolve. In this paper, we present QuanFuzz, a search-based test input generator for quantum program. We define the quantum sensitive information to evaluate test input for quantum program and use matrix generator to generate test cases with higher coverage. Because of the impossibility of copying qubit, we record the operations which lead initial seeds to test inputs instead of recording qubits themselves. First, we extract quantum sensitive information – measurement operations on those quantum registers and the sensitive branches associated with those measurement results, from the quantum source code. Then, we use the sensitive information guided algorithm to mutate the initial input matrix and select those matrices which improve the probability weight for a value of the quantum register to trigger the sensitive branch. QuanFuzz on benchmarks and acquired 20% - 60% more coverage compared to traditional testing methods.","@inproceedings{wang2021poster,

Quantum simulators have thus been introduced to help software developers. There are, however, no formal proofs that these simulators behave in exactly the way that real quantum hardware does, which could lead to errors in their implementation. Here we propose to use a search-based technique, grammar-based fuzzing, to generate syntactically valid quantum programs, and use differential testing to search for inconsistent behaviour between selected quantum simulators. We tested our approach on three simulators: Braket, Quantastica, and Qiskit. Overall, we generated and ran over 400k testcases, 2,327 of which found new coverage, and 292 of which caused crashes, hangs or divergent behaviour. Our analysis revealed 4 classes of bugs, including a bug in the OpenQASM 3 stdgates.inc standard gates library, affecting all the simulators. All but one of the bugs reported to the developers have been already fixed by them, while the remaining bug has been acknowledged as a true bug.","@inproceedings{blackwell2024fuzzing,

This paper presents QChecker, a static analysis tool that supports finding bugs in quantum programs in Qiskit. QChecker consists of two main modules: a module for extracting program information based on abstract syntax tree (AST), and a module for detecting bugs based on patterns.

assurance of quantum programs. However, existing techniques
face many challenges, such as constructing test oracles and
distinguishing genuine faults from noise-induced errors. Propertybased testing is a promising solution for dealing with the test oracle
issue, which verifies general properties rather than requiring
inputs and outputs. However, its effectiveness in noisy quantum
environments has not been studied. To this end, we evaluate the
feasibility of applying property-based testing in noisy quantum
computers by integrating it with a state-of-the-art machine
learning-based noise mitigation method called QOIN.
Our results show that on average, QOIN mitigates noise for
individual circuits, though it may introduce outliers. Crucially,
this does not guarantee property preservation: We show that
some properties align better with QOIN, while others remain
closer under unmitigated noise. To address this, we apply a hybrid
approach that selectively applies QOIN during property-based
testing. We show that this hybrid approach improves alignment
with the ideal execution and significantly reduces false positives in
assertion outcomes across most executed mutants. This provides
a solid foundation for applying property-based testing to noisy
quantum systems.

The model we adopt is a quantum state machine, which is a natural quantum generalization of Mealy machines. A major difficulty in checking quantum circuits (but not present in checking classical circuits) is that the state spaces of quantum circuits are continuums. This difficulty is resolved by our main theorem showing that equivalence checking of two quantum Mealy machines can be done with input sequences that are taken from some chosen basis (which are finite) and have a length quadratic in the dimensions of the state Hilbert spaces of the machines. Based on this theoretical result, we develop an (and to the best of our knowledge, the first) algorithm for checking equivalence of sequential quantum circuits with running time O(23m+5l(23m+23l)) , where m and l denote the numbers of input and internal qubits, respectively. The complexity of our algorithm is comparable with that of the known algorithms for checking classical sequential circuits in the sense that both are exponential in the number of (qu)bits.

It indicates that a single transistor’s size is advancing at the atomic scale in future computing technologies. The gain of loss-less bit information in reversible logic computation is highly acceptable in modern computing devices. Therefore, motivated by these, researchers have explored the reversible logic concept for applying newer technologies such as quantum computing, optical computing, nanotechnology, DNA computing, digital communication systems, low-power CMOS design, etc. In the current literature, numerous developments on synthesis and optimization in reversible circuits have been proposed. Simultaneously, in order to observe the correct behavior of reversible circuits in terms of performing the correct functionality and integrity performance, testing plays an important role. In this article, we consider a fault model labeled the Mixed Control Flipping Fault (MixCFF) model that is applied in the reversible circuit, which is also relevant to the quantum circuits for representing the faults. The proposed work presents an automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) algorithm to detect the MixCFF. The proposed MixCFF model enables the correlation between the existing fault models in the reversible circuit, which are also presented in the proposed work. Experimental results are evaluated based on the MixCFF detection and the MixCFF fault coverage range with the help of different benchmark circuits using the suggested ATPG algorithm.","@article{handique2025logical,

This is done by bridging some testing and debugging techniques from the classical world, such as hypothesis and binary-like testing, and debugging-assistance functions, such as tracking gates and detecting qubits' light cones. In addition, we collected and studied bugs from Stack Exchange, Stack Overflow, and GitHub and categorized these bugs based on their source to provide developers with tools and information for an efficient and systematic debugging process for their programs.},

Runtime assertion is challenging in quantum computing for two key reasons. First, a quantum bit (qubit) cannot be copied, which is known as the non-cloning theorem. Second, when a qubit is measured, its superposition state collapses into a classical state, losing the inherent parallel information. In this paper, we overcome these challenges with runtime computation through ancilla qubits, which are used to indirectly collect the information of the qubits of interest. We design quantum circuits to assert classical states, entanglement, and superposition states. Our experimental results show that they are effective in debugging as well as improving the success rate for various quantum algorithms on IBM Q quantum computers.","@inproceedings{liu2020quantum,

Quantum program testing has emerged as a prominent research area within the scope of quantum software engineering. While numerous approaches have been proposed to address quantum program quality assurance, our analysis reveals that most existing methods rely on measurement-based validation in practice. However, due to the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum programs, measurement-based validation methods face significant limitations.
To investigate these limitations, we conducted an empirical study of recent research on quantum program testing, analyzing measurement-based validation methods in the literature. Our analysis categorizes existing measurement-based validation methods into two groups: distribution-level validation and output-value-level validation. We then compare measurement-based validation with statevector-based validation methods to evaluate their pros and cons. Our findings demonstrate that measurement-based validation is suitable for straightforward assessments, such as verifying the existence of specific output values, while statevector-based validation proves more effective for complicated tasks such as assessing the program behaviors.","@article{ye2025measurement,

However, due to the inherently non-classical nature of quantum mechanics, verifying QNNs poses significant challenges. To address this, we propose QCov, a set of test coverage criteria specifically designed to systematically evaluate QNN state exploration during testing, with an emphasis on superposition. These criteria help evaluate test diversity and detect underlying defects within test suites. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and QNN models validate QCov's effectiveness in reflecting test quality, guiding fuzz testing efficiently, and thereby improving QNN robustness.

In this paper, we first discuss several critical issues that must be considered when testing multi-subroutine quantum programs and point out the limitations and problems with existing testing methods. We then present a novel framework for testing multi-subroutine quantum programs that allow for both unit and integration testing. Our framework includes two novel test coverage criteria for the equivalent class partition of quantum variables to guide our testing tasks and techniques to test quantum programs with several common patterns.

In this paper, we present Bloq, a scalable, automated fault localization approach introducing Bloch-vector-based assertions utilizing expectation value measurements of Pauli operators, enabling low-overhead fault localization without mid-circuit measurements. In addition, we introduce AutoBloq, a component of Bloq for automatically generating assertion schemes from quantum algorithms. An experimental evaluation over 684432 programs using two algorithms (Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Grover) shows that Bloq consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach Proq, notably as circuit depth and noise increase. For Grover, Bloq achieves a mean F1 score across all experimental instances of 0.74 versus 0.38 for Proq under ideal conditions, and maintains performance under noise (0.43 versus 0.06). Bloq also reduces Proq's runtime by a factor of 5 and circuit depth overhead by a factor of 23.

119,1,"QuCheck: A Property-based Testing Framework for Quantum
Programs in Qiskit
","Property-based testing has been previously proposed for quantum programs in Q# with QSharpCheck; however, this implementation was limited in functionality, lacked extensibility, and was evaluated on a narrow range of programs using a single property. To address these limitations, we propose QuCheck, an enhanced property-based testing framework in Qiskit. By leveraging Qiskit and the broader Python ecosystem, QuCheck facilitates property construction, introduces flexible input generators and assertions, and supports expressive preconditions. We assessed its effectiveness through mutation analysis on five quantum programs (2-10 qubits), varying the number of properties, inputs, and measurement shots to assess their impact on fault detection and demonstrate the effectiveness of property-based testing across a range of conditions.

To address these limitations, we propose QuCheck, an enhanced property-based testing framework in Qiskit. By leveraging Qiskit and the broader Python ecosystem, QuCheck facilitates property construction, introduces flexible input generators and assertions, and supports expressive preconditions. We assessed its effectiveness through mutation analysis on five quantum programs (2-10 qubits), varying the number of properties, inputs, and measurement shots to assess their impact on fault detection and demonstrate the effectiveness of property-based testing across a range of conditions.

As more programmers are starting to look at writing quantum programs, they need to test and debug their code. In this paper, we discuss various use-cases for quantum computers, either standalone or as part of a System of Systems. Based on these use-cases, we discuss some testing and debugging tactics that one can leverage to ensure the quality of the quantum software. We also highlight quantum-computer-specific issues and list novel techniques that are needed to address these issues. The practitioners can readily apply some of these tactics to their process of writing quantum programs, while researchers can learn about opportunities for future work.","@article{miranskyy2021testing,

The predicates in Proq are represented by projections (or equivalently, closed subspaces of the state space), following Birkhoff-von Neumann quantum logic. The satisfaction of a projection by a quantum state can be directly checked upon a small number of projective measurements rather than a large number of repeated executions. On the theory side, we rigorously prove that checking projection-based assertions can help locate bugs or statistically assure that the semantic function of the tested program is close to what we expect, for both exact and approximate quantum programs. On the practice side, we consider hardware constraints and introduce several techniques to transform the assertions, making them directly executable on the measurement-restricted quantum computers. We also propose to achieve simplified assertion implementation using local projection technique with soundness guaranteed. We compare Proq with existing quantum program assertions and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Proq by its applications to assert two ingenious quantum algorithms, the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm and Shor's algorithm.","@article{li2019proq,

Based on this runtime visualization, the stability and feasibility of QNN-based software can be tested during runtime operations of autonomous driving functionalities. This software testing of a QNN via dynamic analysis is essentially required due to undetermined probabilistic qubit states during runtime operations. Furthermore, an EQuaTE is capable of visual feedback because the barren plateaus can be identified at local autonomous driving platforms, and the corresponding information will be visualized at remotely connected cloud. Based on this visualized information at the cloud, the QNN, which is also stored at cloud, should be automatically reorganized and retrained for eliminating barren plateaus. Then, the trained parameters can be downloaded into the QNN of autonomous driving platforms.","@ARTICLE{10229500,

125,10,The Cost of Certainty: Shot Budgets in Quantum Program Testing,"Andriy Miranskyy
",2025.0,,ArXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22418,ArXiv,"As quantum computing advances toward early fault-tolerant machines, testing and verification of quantum programs become urgent but costly, since each execution consumes scarce hardware resources. Unlike in classical software testing, every measurement must be carefully budgeted.
This paper develops a unified framework for reasoning about how many measurements are required to verify quantum programs. The goal is to connect theoretical error bounds with concrete test strategies and to extend the analysis from individual tests to full program-level verification.
We analyze the relationship between error probability, fidelity, trace distance, and the quantum Chernoff bound to establish fundamental shot count limits. These foundations are applied to three representative testing methods: the inverse test, the swap test, and the chi-square test. Both idealized and noisy devices are considered. We also introduce a program-level budgeting approach that allocates verification effort across multiple subroutines.
The inverse test is the most measurement efficient, the swap test requires about twice as many shots, and the chi-square test is easiest to implement but often needs orders of magnitude more measurements. In the presence of noise, calibrated baselines may increase measurement requirements beyond theoretical estimates. At the program level, distributing a global fidelity target across many fine-grained functions can cause verification costs to grow rapidly, whereas coarser decompositions or weighted allocations remain more practical.
The framework clarifies trade-offs among different testing strategies, noise handling, and program decomposition. It provides practical guidance for budgeting measurement shots in quantum program testing, helping practitioners balance rigour against cost when designing verification strategies.","@article{miranskyy2025cost,
