Muskit: a mutation analysis tool for quantum software testing,"Mendiluze, E\~{n}aut and Ali, Shaukat and Arcaini, Paolo and Yue, Tao",2022.0,10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678563,Proceedings of the 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678563,IEEE Press,"Given that quantum software testing is a new area of research, there is a lack of benchmark programs and bugs repositories to assess the effectiveness of testing techniques. To this end, quantum mutation analysis focuses on systematically generating faulty versions of Quantum Programs (QPs), called mutants, using mutation operators. Such mutants can be used as benchmarks to assess the quality of test cases in a test suite. Thus, we present Muskit - a quantum mutation analysis tool for QPs coded in IBM's Qiskit language. Muskit defines mutation operators on gates of QPs and selection criteria to reduce the number of mutants to generate. Moreover, it allows for the execution of test cases on mutants and generation of results for test analyses. Muskit is provided as command line interface, GUI, and web application. We validated Muskit by using it to generate and execute mutants for four QPs.

QDiff: differential testing of quantum software stacks,"Wang, Jiyuan and Zhang, Qian and Xu, Guoqing Harry and Kim, Miryung",2022.0,10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678792,Proceedings of the 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678792,IEEE Press,"Over the past few years, several quantum software stacks (QSS) have been developed in response to rapid hardware advances in quantum computing. A QSS includes a quantum programming language, an optimizing compiler that translates a quantum algorithm written in a high-level language into quantum gate instructions, a quantum simulator that emulates these instructions on a classical device, and a software controller that sends analog signals to a very expensive quantum hardware based on quantum circuits. In comparison to traditional compilers and architecture simulators, QSSes are difficult to tests due to the probabilistic nature of results, the lack of clear hardware specifications, and quantum programming complexity.This work devises a novel differential testing approach for QSSes, named QDIFF with three major innovations: (1) We generate input programs to be tested via semantics-preserving, source to source transformation to explore program variants. (2) We speed up differential testing by filtering out quantum circuits that are not worthwhile to execute on quantum hardware by analyzing static characteristics such as a circuit depth, 2-gate operations, gate error rates, and T1 relaxation time. (3) We design an extensible equivalence checking mechanism via distribution comparison functions such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and cross entropy.We evaluate QDiff with three widely-used open source QSSes: Qiskit from IBM, Cirq from Google, and Pyquil from Rigetti. By running QDiff on both real hardware and quantum simulators, we found several critical bugs revealing potential instabilities in these platforms. QDiff's source transformation is effective in producing semantically equivalent yet not-identical circuits (i.e., 34% of trials), and its filtering mechanism can speed up differential testing by 66%.",[Y],[N]
Quito: a coverage-guided test generator for quantum programs,"Wang, Xinyi and Arcaini, Paolo and Yue, Tao and Ali, Shaukat",2022.0,10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678798,Proceedings of the 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678798,IEEE Press,"Automation in quantum software testing is essential to support systematic and cost-effective testing. Towards this direction, we present a quantum software testing tool called Quito that can automatically generate test suites covering three coverage criteria defined on inputs and outputs of a quantum program coded in Qiskit, i.e., input coverage, output coverage, and input-output coverage. Quito also implements two types of test oracles based on program specifications, i.e., checking whether a quantum program produced a wrong output or checking a probabilistic test oracle with statistical test. We describe the architecture and methodology of the tool. We also validated the tool with one quantum program and one faulty version of it. Results indicate that Quito can generate test suites and perform test assessments that detect faults, and produce test results with a good time performance.Quito's code: https://github.com/Simula-COMPLEX/quitoQuito's video: https://youtu.be/kuI9QaCo8A8Artifact Available: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5288665",[Y],[Y]

However, there is no suitable benchmark suite that can systematically evaluate the debugging and testing methods of quantum programs until now. This paper proposes Bugs4Q, a benchmark of thirty-six real, manually validated Qiskit bugs from four popular Qiskit elements (Terra, Aer, Ignis, and Aqua), supplemented with the test cases for reproducing buggy behaviors. Bugs4Q also provides interfaces for accessing the buggy and fixed versions of the Qiskit programs and executing the corresponding test cases, facilitating the reproducible empirical studies and comparisons of Qiskit program debugging and testing tools.

QuCAT: A Combinatorial Testing Tool for Quantum Software,"Wang, Xinyi and Arcaini, Paolo and Yue, Tao and Ali, Shaukat",2024.0,10.1109/ASE56229.2023.00062,Proceedings of the 38th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/ASE56229.2023.00062,IEEE Press,"With the increased developments in quantum computing, the availability of systematic and automatic testing approaches for quantum programs is becoming increasingly essential. To this end, we present the quantum software testing tool QuCAT for combinatorial testing of quantum programs. QuCAT provides two functionalities of use. With the first functionality, the tool generates a test suite of a given strength (e.g., pair-wise). With the second functionality, it generates test suites with increasing strength until a failure is triggered or a maximum strength is reached. QuCAT uses two test oracles to check the correctness of test outputs. We assess the cost and effectiveness of QuCAT with 3 faulty versions of 5 quantum programs. Results show that combinatorial test suites with a low strength can find faults with limited cost, while a higher strength performs better to trigger some difficult faults with relatively higher cost.

QuraTest: Integrating Quantum Specific Features in Quantum Program Testing,"Ye, Jiaming and Xia, Shangzhou and Zhang, Fuyuan and Arcaini, Paolo and Ma, Lei and Zhao, Jianjun and Ishikawa, Fuyuki",2024.0,10.1109/ASE56229.2023.00196,Proceedings of the 38th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/ASE56229.2023.00196,IEEE Press,"The recent fast development of quantum computers breaks several computation limitations that are difficult for conventional computers. Up to the present, although many approaches and tools have been proposed to test quantum programs, the fundamental features of quantum programs, i.e., magnitude, phase, and entanglement, have been largely overlooked, leading to limited fault detection capability and reduced testing effectiveness. To address this problem, we propose an automated testing framework named QURATEST, equipped with three test case generators (including two newly proposed techniques, UCNOT and IQFT in this paper, as well as one based on Random techniques) to test quantum programs. Overall, the proposed generators enable the generation of diverse test inputs by considering the quantum features of quantum programs. In the experiments, we perform an in-depth evaluation of QURATEST from three aspects: generated test case diversity, output coverage of the program under test, and fault detection capability. The results demonstrate the potential of our newly proposed techniques in that IQFT can generate the most diverse test cases regarding magnitude, phase, and entanglement, with 66% cell coverage. Comparatively, the Random approach only has 10% cell coverage. Regarding the evaluations of the output coverage, IQFT can achieve the highest output coverage in 70.2% (33 out of 47) of all quantum programs. In terms of fault detection, UCNOT outperforms the other two techniques. Specifically, the test cases generated by UCNOT have the best mutation score in 88.4% (23 out of 26) quantum programs.",[Y],[Y]
QcAssert: Quantum Device Testing with Concurrent Assertions,"Witharana, Hasini and Volya, Daniel and Mishra, Prabhat",2024.0,10.1109/ASP-DAC58780.2024.10473900,Proceedings of the 29th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference,https://doi.org/10.1109/ASP-DAC58780.2024.10473900,IEEE Press,"Quantum devices are extremely noisy due to its inherent architecture. This can introduce errors or completely erase the information stored in qubits. High noise levels in a quantum device can lead to errors even when the quantum circuit is not buggy. Therefore, it is essential to verify that the noise level of the device is tolerable while running the quantum circuit. In this paper, we propose a quantum device testing framework using concurrent assertions. Specifically, we introduce a new type of assertion ""QcAssert"", which has the ability to run concurrently with the quantum circuit to ensure that the quantum device is working as expected. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the QcAssert in dynamic device testing using a suite of popular quantum benchmarks, including Shor's factoring algorithm and Grover's search algorithm.",[Y],[N]
Ecmas: Efficient Circuit Mapping and Scheduling for Surface Code,"Zhu, Mingzheng and Fu, Hao and Wu, Jun and Zhang, Chi and Xie, Wei and Li, Xiang-Yang",2024.0,10.1109/CGO57630.2024.10444874,Proceedings of the 2024 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization,https://doi.org/10.1109/CGO57630.2024.10444874,IEEE Press,"As the leading candidate of quantum error correction codes, surface code suffers from significant overhead, such as execution time. Reducing the circuit's execution time not only enhances its execution efficiency but also improves fidelity. However, finding the shortest execution time is NP-hard.In this work, we study the surface code mapping and scheduling problem. To reduce the execution time of a quantum circuit, we first introduce two novel metrics: Circuit Parallelism Degree and Chip Communication Capacity to quantitatively characterize quantum circuits and chips. Then, we propose a resource-adaptive mapping and scheduling method, named Ecmas, with customized initialization of chip resources for each circuit. Ecmas can dramatically reduce the execution time in both double defect and lattice surgery models. Furthermore, we provide an additional version Ecmas-ReSu for sufficient qubits, which is performance-guaranteed and more efficient. Extensive numerical tests on practical datasets show that Ecmas outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by reducing the execution time by 51.5% on average for double defect model. Ecmas can reach the optimal result in most benchmarks, reducing the execution time by up to 13.9% for lattice surgery model.",[N],N/A

Given the foundations in quantum mechanics, the way quantum computations are performed is significantly different than classical computing. Therefore, quantum software testing also differs from classical software testing. There has been quite an interest in building quantum software testing techniques since 2019 in the software engineering (SE) community. Thus, we aim to introduce quantum software testing to the SE community. In particular, we will present the basic foundations of quantum computing and quantum programming as circuits, followed by the current state of the art on quantum software testing. Next, we will present some basic quantum software testing techniques and finally give the research directions that deserve attention from the SE community.",[Y],[N]
Addressing Recurring Bugs and Workflow Challenges in Quantum Software Engineering,"Zappin, Jake",2025.0,10.1109/ICSE-Companion66252.2025.00054,2025 IEEE/ACM 47th International Conference on Software Engineering: Companion Proceedings (ICSE-Companion),https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE-Companion66252.2025.00054,IEEE Press,"This research addresses the unique challenges faced by quantum and hybrid quantum-classical (HQC) software developers, focusing on recurring bugs and workflow inefficiencies. Through an empirical analysis of developer forums, a comprehensive taxonomy of issues was developed, categorizing previously undocumented errors in areas such as quantum state manipulation, gate operations, and hybrid quantum-classical (HQC) integration. Building on these insights, this work proposes the development of specialized tools and methodologies informed by practitioners—such as a static analysis tool and an automated testing framework—to support effective debugging and testing in quantum applications. The ultimate goal is to enhance productivity and reliability in quantum software engineering, contributing to a robust quantum development ecosystem.",[Y],[N]

MorphQ: Metamorphic Testing of the Qiskit Quantum Computing Platform,"Paltenghi, Matteo and Pradel, Michael",2023.0,10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00202,2023 IEEE/ACM 45th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE),https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00202,IEEE Press,"As quantum computing is becoming increasingly popular, the underlying quantum computing platforms are growing both in ability and complexity. Unfortunately, testing these platforms is challenging due to the relatively small number of existing quantum programs and because of the oracle problem, i.e., a lack of specifications of the expected behavior of programs. This paper presents MorphQ, the first metamorphic testing approach for quantum computing platforms. Our two key contributions are (i) a program generator that creates a large and diverse set of valid (i.e., non-crashing) quantum programs, and (ii) a set of program transformations that exploit quantum-specific metamorphic relationships to alleviate the oracle problem. Evaluating the approach by testing the popular Qiskit platform shows that the approach creates over 8k program pairs within two days, many of which expose crashes. Inspecting the crashes, we find 13 bugs, nine of which have already been confirmed. MorphQ widens the slim portfolio of testing techniques of quantum computing platforms, helping to create a reliable software stack for this increasingly important field.",[Y],[N]

Softw.,https://doi.org/10.1145/2699464,Association for Computing Machinery,"A hierarchy of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations approximates the global optimum of polynomial optimization problems of noncommuting variables. Generating the relaxation, however, is a computationally demanding task, and only problems of commuting variables have efficient generators. We develop an implementation for problems of noncommuting variables that creates the relaxation to be solved by SDPA--a high-performance solver that runs in a distributed environment. We further exploit the inherent sparsity of optimization problems in quantum physics to reduce the complexity of the resulting relaxations. Constrained problems with a relaxation of order two may contain up to a hundred variables. The implementation is available in Python. The tool helps solve such as finding the ground state energy or testing quantum correlations.",[N],N/A

Reversible Synthesis of Symmetric Functions with a Simple Regular Structure and Easy Testability,"Deb, Arighna and Das, Debesh K. and Rahaman, Hafizur and Wille, Robert and Drechsler, Rolf and Bhattacharya, Bhargab B.",2016.0,10.1145/2894757,J. Emerg. Technol. Comput. Syst.,https://doi.org/10.1145/2894757,Association for Computing Machinery,"In this article, we introduce a novel method of synthesizing symmetric Boolean functions with reversible logic gates. In contrast to earlier approaches, the proposed technique deploys a simple, regular, and cascaded structure consisting of an array of Peres and CNOT gates, which results in significant reduction with respect to the quantum cost. However, the number of circuit inputs may increase slightly when such cascades are used. In order to reduce their number, we next propose a postsynthesis optimization phase that allows judicious reuse of circuit lines. In addition to offering a cost-effective synthesis methodology, the proposed reversible logic structure supports elegant testability properties. With respect to all single or partial missing gate faults (SMGFs and PMGFs), or repeated gate faults (RGFs) in such an n-input circuit module, we show that it admits a universal test set of constant cardinality (=3) for any value of n. Thus, considering both the cost and testability issues, this approach provides a superior option for synthesizing symmetric functions compared to existing designs.",[N],N/A
Delayed Update Algorithms for Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation on GPU: Extended Abstract,"McDaniel, Tyler and D'Azevedo, Ed and Li, Ying Wai and Kent, Paul and Wong, Ming and Wong, Kwai",2016.0,10.1145/2949550.2949579,"Proceedings of the XSEDE16 Conference on Diversity, Big Data, and Science at Scale",https://doi.org/10.1145/2949550.2949579,Association for Computing Machinery,"QMCPACK is open source scientific software designed to perform Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation, a first-principles method for describing many-body systems. The evaluation of each Monte Carlo move requires finding the determinant of a dense matrix in the wave functions. This calculation forms a key computational kernel in QMCPACK. After each accepted event, the wave function matrix undergoes a rank-one update to represent a single particle move within the system. The matrix inverse is updated via the Sherman-Morrison formula; occasionally, the explicit inverse must be recomputed to maintain numerical stability.; We propose an alternate approach to this kernel that utilizes QR factorization to maintain stability without refactorization. In addition, algorithms based on a novel delayed update scheme are explored in this effort. This strategy enables probability evaluation for multiple successive Monte Carlo moves, with application of accepted moves to the wave function matrix delayed until an event is denied, or a predetermined limit on acceptances p is reached. Accepted events grouped in this manner are then applied to the matrix en bloc with enhanced arithmetic intensity and computational efficiency.Delayed update Sherman-Morrison probability evaluation algorithms with CPU and GPU-accelerated implementations are tested, profiled, and analyzed. A QR based delayed update algorithm remains in development. Results are evaluated against existing methods for numerical stability and efficiency; emphasis is placed on large systems, for which acceleration is critical.",[N],N/A

To BLISS-B or not to be: Attacking strongSwan's Implementation of Post-Quantum Signatures,"Pessl, Peter and Bruinderink, Leon Groot and Yarom, Yuval",2017.0,10.1145/3133956.3134023,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,https://doi.org/10.1145/3133956.3134023,Association for Computing Machinery,"In the search for post-quantum secure alternatives to RSA and ECC, lattice-based cryptography appears to be an attractive and efficient option. A particularly interesting lattice-based signature scheme is BLISS, offering key and signature sizes in the range of RSA moduli. A range of works on efficient implementations of BLISS is available, and the scheme has seen a first real-world adoption in strongSwan, an IPsec-based VPN suite. In contrast, the implementation-security aspects of BLISS, and lattice-based cryptography in general, are still largely unexplored.At CHES 2016, Groot Bruinderink et al. presented the first side-channel attack on BLISS, thus proving that this topic cannot be neglected. Nevertheless, their attack has some limitations. First, the technique is demonstrated via a proof-of-concept experiment that was not performed under realistic attack settings. Furthermore, the attack does not apply to BLISS-B, an improved variant of BLISS and also the default option in strongSwan. This problem also applies to later works on implementation security of BLISS.In this work, we solve both of the above problems. We present a new side-channel key-recovery algorithm against both the original BLISS and the BLISS-B variant. Our key-recovery algorithm draws on a wide array of techniques, including learning-parity with noise, integer programs, maximimum likelihood tests, and a lattice-basis reduction. With each application of a technique, we reveal additional information on the secret key culminating in a complete key recovery.Finally, we show that cache attacks on post-quantum cryptography are not only possible, but also practical. We mount an asynchronous cache attack on the production-grade BLISS-B implementation of strongSwan. The attack recovers the secret signing key after observing roughly 6000 signature generations.",[N],N/A

Also, a quantum Grover attack is modeled on the proposed quantum S-AES. First, quantum circuits for the main components of S-AES in the finite field F2[x]/(x4 + x + 1), are constructed. Then, the constructed circuits are put together to form a quantum version of S-AES. A C-NOT synthesis is used to decompose some of the functions to reduce the number of the needed qubits. The quantum S-AES is integrated into a black-box queried by Grover's algorithm. A new approach is proposed to uniquely recover the secret key when Grover attack is applied. The entire work is simulated and tested on a quantum mechanics simulator. The complexity analysis shows that a block cipher can be designed as a quantum circuit with a polynomial cost. In addition, the secret key is recovered in quadratic speedup as promised by Grover's algorithm.",[N],N/A

Statistical assertions for validating patterns and finding bugs in quantum programs,"Huang, Yipeng and Martonosi, Margaret",2019.0,10.1145/3307650.3322213,Proceedings of the 46th International Symposium on Computer Architecture,https://doi.org/10.1145/3307650.3322213,Association for Computing Machinery,"In support of the growing interest in quantum computing experimentation, programmers need new tools to write quantum algorithms as program code. Compared to debugging classical programs, debugging quantum programs is difficult because programmers have limited ability to probe the internal states of quantum programs; those states are difficult to interpret even when observations exist; and programmers do not yet have guidelines for what to check for when building quantum programs. In this work, we present quantum program assertions based on statistical tests on classical observations. These allow programmers to decide if a quantum program state matches its expected value in one of classical, superposition, or entangled types of states. We extend an existing quantum programming language with the ability to specify quantum assertions, which our tool then checks in a quantum program simulator. We use these assertions to debug three benchmark quantum programs in factoring, search, and chemistry.

In 2016, the successful fabrication and testing of AQFP-based circuits with the scale of 83,000 JJs have demonstrated the scalability and potential of implementing large-scale systems using AQFP. As a result, it will be promising for AQFP in high-performance computing and deep space applications, with Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference acceleration as an important example.Besides ultra-high energy efficiency, AQFP exhibits two unique characteristics: the deep pipelining nature since each AQFP logic gate is connected with an AC clock signal, which increases the difficulty to avoid RAW hazards; the second is the unique opportunity of true random number generation (RNG) using a single AQFP buffer, far more efficient than RNG in CMOS. We point out that these two characteristics make AQFP especially compatible with the stochastic computing (SC) technique, which uses a time-independent bit sequence for value representation, and is compatible with the deep pipelining nature. Further, the application of SC has been investigated in DNNs in prior work, and the suitability has been illustrated as SC is more compatible with approximate computations.This work is the first to develop an SC-based DNN acceleration framework using AQFP technology. The deep-pipelining nature of AQFP circuits translates into the difficulty in designing accumulators/counters in AQFP, which makes the prior design in SC-based DNN not suitable. We overcome this limitation taking into account different properties in CONV and FC layers: (i) the inner product calculation in FC layers has more number of inputs than that in CONV layers; (ii) accurate activation function is critical in CONV rather than FC layers. Based on these observations, we propose (i) accurate integration of summation and activation function in CONV layers using bitonic sorting network and feedback loop, and (ii) low-complexity categorization block for FC layers based on chain of majority gates. For complete design we also develop (i) ultra-efficient stochastic number generator in AQFP, (ii) a high-accuracy sub-sampling (pooling) block in AQFP, and (iii) majority synthesis for further performance improvement and automatic buffer/splitter insertion for requirement of AQFP circuits. Experimental results suggest that the proposed SC-based DNN using AQFP can achieve up to 6.8 \texttimes{} 104 times higher energy efficiency compared to CMOS-based implementation while maintaining 96% accuracy on the MNIST dataset.",[N],N/A

There is rapidly growing demand for a quantum workforce educated in the basics of quantum computing. However, there have been very few offerings that help the learner to bridge the gap between the theoretical quantum computing knowledge and applying it to solving real-world problems.The Quantum Katas project has been designed specifically to reduce that gap. Each kata is a sequence of programming exercises that walk the learner through one or several closely related topics in quantum computing. The learner turns to the kata once they have studied the theory on this topic, to internalize their new knowledge. Each exercise requires writing a fragment of code in Q# - a quantum programming language. Most importantly, each kata includes a testing framework that provides immediate feedback for the attempted solutions, allowing the learner to study at their own pace even without access to instructor. This makes the project beneficial both for instructor-led studies and for self-learning. The Quantum Katas are an open-source project available at https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas.In this demo I will showcase the Quantum Katas and talk about our experience using them in a variety of learning environments, from guided university courses to workshops and study groups to self-paced learning.",[N],N/A

In this paper we propose a solution for this problem. The permutation problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. Solving the ILP problem, the lowest cost permutation for the CNOT mappings is guaranteed. To test and validated the proposed formulation, quantum architectures with 5 and 16 qubits were used. The ILP formulation along with mapping techniques found circuits with up to 64% fewer gates than other approaches.",[N],N/A

This is critical, as quantum machines can barely support the execution of short programs before failing.However, GRAPE suffers from high compilation latency, which is untenable in variational algorithms since compilation is interleaved with computation. We propose two strategies for partial compilation, exploiting the structure of variational circuits to pre-compile optimal pulses for specific blocks of gates.

We find that a single-number metric describing the fidelity of individual gates is a useful but imperfect guide.Our compiler uses this subsystem and maps complete circuits onto the machine using a beam search-based heuristic that will scale as processor and program sizes grow. To evaluate the whole compilation process, we compiled and executed adder circuits, then calculated the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL-divergence, a measure of the distance between two probability distributions).

We, for the first time, experimentally test Hardy’s paradox of non-locality in superconducting qubits. For practical verification of Hardy’s paradox, we argue that the error-modeling used in optical circuits is not useful for superconducting qubits. So, we propose a new error-modeling for Hardy’s paradox and a new method to estimate the lower bound on Hardy’s probability (i.e., the probability of a specific event in Hardy’s test) for superconducting qubits. Our results confirmed the theory that any non-maximally entangled state of two qubits violates Hardy’s equations; whereas, any maximally entangled state and product state of two qubits do not exhibit Hardy’s non-locality.

Near-term quantum computers referred to as Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are expected to operate in the presence of errors. To run a quantum circuit on a NISQ computer, the circuit should be mapped to satisfy the physical constraints of the quantum architecture. The mapping process takes into account the error rates of the quantum hardware. It selects physical qubits and their movements, which minimize the circuit error rates. The output of the quantum circuit can be obtained through several runs on NISQ computers.What's important from a security perspective is that the output of the quantum circuit is inherently dependent on the error parameters of the quantum hardware. An adversary can, therefore, leverage such dependency to alter the functional behavior of the quantum circuit. We show that malicious changes in the error rates used for mapping quantum circuits can change their output. To detect this attack on NISQ architectures, we propose inserting test points into the quantum circuits to study their error rates with respect to other qubit allocations. We utilize superposition, classical, and un-compute tests to provide side-channel information of the quantum circuit. We study the effectiveness of our approach using IBMQ 16 Melbourne quantum computer and Qiskit tools as an exemplar.",[N],N/A

The client’s goal is to use as few resources as possible. This problem, first raised by Broadbent, Fitzsimons and Kashefi [FOCS 2009], has become fundamental to the study of quantum cryptography, not only because of its own importance, but also because it provides a testbed for new techniques that can be later applied to related problems (for example, quantum computation verification). Known protocols on this problem are mainly either information-theoretically (IT) secure or based on trapdoor assumptions (public key encryptions). In this paper we study how the availability of symmetric-key primitives, modeled by a random oracle, changes the complexity of universal blind quantum computation. We give a new universal blind quantum computation protocol. Similar to previous works on IT-secure protocols (for example, Broadbent-Fitzsimons-Kashefi), our protocol can be divided into two phases. In the first phase the client prepares some quantum gadgets with relatively simple quantum gates and sends them to the server, and in the second phase the client is entirely classical — it does not even need quantum storage. Crucially, the protocol’s first phase is succinct, that is, its complexity is independent of the circuit size. Given the security parameter κ, its complexity is only a fixed polynomial of κ, and can be used to evaluate any circuit (or several circuits) of size up to a subexponential of κ. In contrast, known schemes either require the client to perform quantum computations that scale with the size of the circuit, or require trapdoor assumptions.",[N],N/A

On the theory side, we rigorously prove that checking projection-based assertions can help locate bugs or statistically assure that the semantic function of the tested program is close to what we expect, for both exact and approximate quantum programs.

Hence, it is crucial for the control microarchitecture to issue quantum operations to the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) in time. As in classical microarchitecture, parallelism in quantum programs needs to be exploited for speedup. However, three challenges emerge in the quantum scenario: 1) the quantum feedback control can introduce significant pipeline stall latency; 2) timing control is required for all quantum operations; 3) QPU requires a deterministic operation supply to prevent the accumulation of quantum errors. In this paper, we propose a novel control microarchitecture design to exploit Circuit Level Parallelism (CLP) and Quantum Operation Level Parallelism (QOLP). Firstly, we develop a Multiprocessor architecture to exploit CLP, which supports dynamic scheduling of different sub-circuits. This architecture can handle parallel feedback control and minimize the potential overhead that disrupts the timing control. Secondly, we propose a Quantum Superscalar approach that exploits QOLP by efficiently executing massive quantum instructions in parallel. Both methods issue quantum operations to QPU deterministically. In the benchmark test of a Shor syndrome measurement, a six-core implementation of our proposal achieves up to 2.59 \texttimes{} speedup compared with a single core. For various canonical quantum computing algorithms, our superscalar approach achieves an average of 4.04 \texttimes{} improvement over a baseline design.

Syst.,https://doi.org/10.1145/3476799,Association for Computing Machinery,"Key exchange protocols and key encapsulation mechanisms establish secret keys to communicate digital information confidentially over public channels. Lattice-based cryptography variants of these protocols are promising alternatives given their quantum-cryptanalysis resistance and implementation efficiency. Although lattice cryptosystems can be mathematically secure, their implementations have shown side-channel vulnerabilities. But such attacks largely presume collecting multiple measurements under a fixed key, leaving the more dangerous single-trace attacks unexplored. This article demonstrates successful single-trace power side-channel attacks on lattice-based key exchange and encapsulation protocols. Our attack targets both hardware and software implementations of matrix multiplications used in lattice cryptosystems. The crux of our idea is to apply a horizontal attack that makes hypotheses on several intermediate values within a single execution all relating to the same secret, and to combine their correlations for accurately estimating the secret key. We illustrate that the design of protocols combined with the nature of lattice arithmetic enables our attack. Since a straightforward attack suffers from false positives, we demonstrate a novel extend-and-prune procedure to recover the key by following the sequence of intermediate updates during multiplication. We analyzed two protocols, Frodo and FrodoKEM, and reveal that they are vulnerable to our attack. We implement both stand-alone hardware and RISC-V based software realizations and test the effectiveness of the proposed attack by using concrete parameters of these protocols on physical platforms with real measurements. We show that the proposed attack can estimate secret keys from a single power measurement with over 99% success rate.",[N],N/A

Syst.,https://doi.org/10.1145/3477928,Association for Computing Machinery,"Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers consisting of tens of inherently noisy quantum bits (qubits) suffer from reliability problems. Qubits and their gates are susceptible to various types of errors. Due to limited numbers of qubits and high error rates, quantum error correction cannot be applied. Physical constraints of quantum hardware including the error rates are used to guide the design and the layout of quantum circuits. The error rates determine the selection of qubits and their operations. The resulting circuit is executed on the quantum computer.This study explores the risk of unexpected changes in the error rates of NISQ computers post-calibration. We show that unexpected changes in error rates can alter the output state of a quantum circuit. To detect these changes, we propose the insertion of test points into the quantum circuit to enable online monitoring of the physical qubit behavior. We utilize classical, superposition, and uncompute test points. Furthermore, we use a gate error coverage metric to assess the quality of the tests. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on different IBM quantum computers (IBM Q), in addition to a noisy simulation that shows the scalability of the proposed approach.",[Y],[Y]

However, there is no established baseline on which to judge current and future progress in equivalence checking of quantum circuits. In order to close this gap, we conduct a detailed case study of two of the most promising equivalence checking methodologies---one based on decision diagrams and one based on the ZX-calculus---and compare their strengths and weaknesses.",[N],N/A

The repeat-until-success algorithm has to be run O(κ/(1-ε)) times to succeed, leveraging amplitude amplification, and needs to be sampled O(1/ε2) times. Thus, the algorithm achieves an exponential improvement with respect to N over classical methods. In particular, we present efficient oracles for state preparation, Hamiltonian simulation, and a set of observables together with the corresponding error and complexity analyses. As the main result of this work, we show how to use Richardson extrapolation to enhance Hamiltonian simulation, resulting in an implementation of Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) within the algorithm with 1/√ε circuits that can be run in parallel each with circuit complexity 1/√ ε  instead of 1/ε. Furthermore, we analyze necessary conditions for the overall algorithm to achieve an exponential speedup compared to classical methods. Our approach is not limited to the considered setting and can be applied to more general problems where Hamiltonian simulation is approximated via product formulae, although our theoretical results would need to be extended accordingly.

Untrusted third parties or a particular version of a trusted compiler may allow an attacker to steal, clone, and/or reverse engineer the quantum circuit. We propose to obfuscate quantum circuits by employing dummy CNOT gates to prevent such threats. If the adversary clones the obfuscated design, he/she will get faulty results. We propose a metric-based dummy gate insertion process to ensure maximum corruption of functionality measured using Total Variation Distance (TVD) and validated using IBM’s noisy simulators.

For a given circuit evaluated on a specific set of qubits, we evaluate: how frequently the qubits return an optimal solution to the problem, the fairness with which the qubits sample from all optimal solutions, and the reported hardware error rate of the qubits. To quantify fairness, we define a novel metric based on Pearson’s χ2 test. We find that fairness is relatively high for circuits with small and large error rates, but drops for circuits with medium error rates. This indicates that structured errors dominate in this regime, while unstructured errors, which are random and thus inherently fair, dominate in noisier qubits and longer circuits. Our results show that fairness can be a powerful tool for understanding the intricate web of errors affecting current NISQ hardware.",[N],N/A

An effective test suite should find faults (or kill mutants) with a minimum number of test cases, to save resources required for executing test cases. In this paper, in the context of mutation testing for quantum programs, we present a multi-objective and search-based approach (MutTG) to generate the minimum number of test cases killing as many mutants as possible. MutTG tries to estimate the likelihood that a mutant is equivalent, and uses this as a discount factor in the fitness definition to avoid keeping on trying to kill mutants that cannot be killed. We employed NSGA-II as the multi-objective search algorithm. Then, we compared MutTG with another version of the approach that does not use the discount factor in its fitness definition, and with random search (RS), over a set of open-source quantum programs and their mutants of varying complexity. Results show that the discount factor does indeed help in guiding the test generation, as the approach with the discount factor performs better than the one without it.",[Y],[Y]

The succinctness of algebraic reasoning would be especially desirable for scalable analysis of quantum programs, given the involvement of exponential-size matrices in most of the existing methods. A few key features of KAT including the idempotent law and the nice properties of classical tests, however, fail to hold in the context of quantum programs due to their unique quantum features, especially in branching. We propose Non-idempotent Kleene Algebra (NKA) as a natural alternative and identify complete and sound semantic models for NKA as well as their quantum interpretations. In light of applications of KAT, we demonstrate algebraic proofs in NKA of quantum compiler optimization and the normal form of quantum while-programs. Moreover, we extend NKA with Tests (i.e., NKAT), where tests model quantum predicates following effect algebra, and illustrate how to encode propositional quantum Hoare logic as NKAT theorems.",[N],N/A

In this sense, there exist 2- and 3-qubit quantum gates such as Controlled-NOT, Toffoli (Controlled-Controlled-NOT), Controlled-Hadamard, Controlled-Swap and so on. In order to make complex quantum circuits easier and control more qubits, it is necessary to work out mathematical models of new control gates acting on more than three qubits depending on the state of control qubit. Therefore, in this work, mathematical model of multi-qubit universal control gate is worked out and some control gates are formulated in accordance with the proposed model, moreover the tests of these novel control gates are carried out using online open resource or virtual laboratory that is called “Quirk”. Existing 2- and 3-qubit control gates can also be derived using this model.

The LEAP algorithm improves scaling across these dimensions using iterative circuit synthesis, incremental reoptimization, dimensionality reduction, and improved numerical optimization. LEAP draws on the design of the optimal synthesis algorithm QSearch by extending it with an incremental approach to determine constant prefix solutions for a circuit. By narrowing the search space, LEAP improves scalability from four to six qubit circuits. LEAP was evaluated with known quantum circuits such as QFT and physical simulation circuits like the VQE, TFIM, and QITE. LEAP can compile four qubit unitaries up to 59\texttimes{} faster than QSearch and five and six qubit unitaries with up to 1.2\texttimes{} fewer CNOTs compared to the QFAST package. LEAP can reduce the CNOT count by up to 36\texttimes{}, or 7\texttimes{} on average, compared to the CQC Tket compiler. Despite its heuristics, LEAP has generated optimal circuits for many test cases with a priori known solutions. The techniques introduced by LEAP are applicable to other numerical optimization based synthesis approaches.",[N],N/A

However, the quantum potential is not only a matter of hardware, but also of software. Therefore, this new paradigm has an impact yet to be explored on software development processes and techniques, and the adaptation of classical software engineering to the new classical/quantum hybrid systems raises a number of important challenges: a new Quantum Software Engineering is therefore needed. Specifically, and focusing on quantum software quality, software verification remains an open research question, as its novelty and complexity make quantum software development a particularly error-prone process. Most current approaches to test-driven verification rely heavily on simulations, which is a problem due to the lack of scalability of simulators running on classical computers. To address this shortcoming, we define the concept of a ""Quantum Test Case"", and then present a method to test quantum circuits on real machines, without using simulation test functionalities such as amplitude calculation or non-destructive measurement. This is achieved by automatically generating a Quantum Test Case, which wraps the circuit under test and performs the verification. We also present the process to run a set of tests on a circuit with this method, along with an example to illustrate the technique.",[Y],[N]
Using Quantum computers to speed up dynamic testing of software,"Miranskyy, Andriy",2022.0,10.1145/3549036.3562061,Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Quantum Programming for Software Engineering,https://doi.org/10.1145/3549036.3562061,Association for Computing Machinery,"Software under test can be analyzed dynamically, while it is being executed, to find defects. However, as the number and possible values of input parameters increase, the cost of dynamic testing rises. This paper examines whether quantum computers (QCs) can help speed up the dynamic testing of programs written for classical computers (CCs). To accomplish this, an approach is devised involving the following three steps: (1) converting a classical program to a quantum program; (2) computing the number of inputs causing errors, denoted by K, using a quantum counting algorithm; and (3) obtaining the actual values of these inputs using Grover’s search algorithm. This approach can accelerate exhaustive and non-exhaustive dynamic testing techniques. On the CC, the computational complexity of these techniques is O(N), where N represents the count of combinations of input parameter values passed to the software under test. In contrast, on the QC, the complexity is O(ε−1 √N/K), where ε is a relative error of measuring K. The paper illustrates how the approach can be applied and discusses its limitations. Moreover, it provides a toy example executed on a simulator and an actual QC. This paper may be of interest to academics and practitioners as the approach presented in the paper may serve as a starting point for exploring the use of QC for dynamic testing of CC code.",[N],N/A

While Over-The-Air (OTA) software upgrade possibility is an essential feature to achieve security, it is also most sensitive to attacks and lots of different firmware upgrade attacks have been presented in the literature. Several security solutions exist to tackle these problems. We observe though that most prior art solutions are public key-based, they are not flexible with respect to firmware image distribution principles and it is challenging to make a design with good Denial-Of-Service (DoS) attacks resistance. Apart from often being rather resource demanding, a limitation with current public key-based solutions is that they are not quantum computer resistant. Hence, in this paper, we take a new look into the firmware upgrade problem and propose RoSym, a secure, firmware distribution principle agnostic, and DoS protected upgrade mechanism purely based on symmetric cryptography. We present an experimental evaluation on a real testbed environment for the scheme. The results show that the scheme is efficient in comparison to other state of the art solutions. We also make a formal security verification of RoSym showing that it is robust against different attacks.",[N],N/A
Verified compilation of Quantum oracles,"Li, Liyi and Voichick, Finn and Hietala, Kesha and Peng, Yuxiang and Wu, Xiaodi and Hicks, Michael",2022.0,10.1145/3563309,Proc. ACM Program. Lang.,https://doi.org/10.1145/3563309,Association for Computing Machinery,"Quantum algorithms often apply classical operations, such as arithmetic or predicate checks, over a quantum superposition of classical data; these so-called oracles are often the largest components of a quantum program. To ease the construction of efficient, correct oracle functions, this paper presents VQO, a high-assurance framework implemented with the Coq proof assistant. The core of VQO is OQASM, the oracle quantum assembly language. OQASM operations move qubits between two different bases via the quantum Fourier transform, thus admitting important optimizations, but without inducing entanglement and the exponential blowup that comes with it. OQASM’s design enabled us to prove correct VQO’s compilers—from a simple imperative language called OQIMP to OQASM, and from OQASM to SQIR, a general-purpose quantum assembly language—and allowed us to efficiently test properties of OQASM programs using the QuickChick property-based testing framework. We have used VQO to implement a variety of arithmetic and geometric operators that are building blocks for important oracles, including those used in Shor’s and Grover’s algorithms. We found that VQO’s QFT-based arithmetic oracles require fewer qubits, sometimes substantially fewer, than those constructed using “classical” gates; VQO’s versions of the latter were nevertheless on par with or better than (in terms of both qubit and gate counts) oracles produced by Quipper, a state-of-the-art but unverified quantum programming platform.",[N],N/A
Memory-Sample Lower Bounds for Learning with Classical-Quantum Hybrid Memory,"Liu, Qipeng and Raz, Ran and Zhan, Wei",2023.0,10.1145/3564246.3585129,Proceedings of the 55th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing,https://doi.org/10.1145/3564246.3585129,Association for Computing Machinery,"In a work by Raz (J. ACM and FOCS 16), it was proved that any algorithm for parity learning on n bits requires either Ω(n2) bits of classical memory or an exponential number (in ‍n) of random samples. A line of recent works continued that research direction and showed that for a large collection of classical learning tasks, either super-linear classical memory size or super-polynomially many samples are needed. All these works consider learning algorithms as classical branching programs, which perform classical computation within bounded memory.      However, these results do not capture all physical computational models, remarkably, quantum computers and the use of quantum memory. It leaves the possibility that a small piece of quantum memory could significantly reduce the need for classical memory or samples and thus completely change the nature of the classical learning task. Despite the recent research on the necessity of quantum memory for intrinsic quantum learning problems like shadow tomography and purity testing, the role of quantum memory in classical learning tasks remains obscure.        In this work, we study classical learning tasks in the presence of quantum memory. We prove that any quantum algorithm with both, classical memory and quantum memory, for parity learning on n bits, requires either Ω(n2) bits of classical memory or Ω(n) bits of quantum memory or an exponential number of samples. In other words, the memory-sample lower bound for parity learning remains qualitatively the same, even if the learning algorithm can use, in addition to the classical memory, a quantum memory of size c n (for some constant c&gt;0).        Our result is more general and applies to many other classical learning tasks. Following previous works, we represent by the matrix M: A \texttimes{} X → {−1,1} the following learning task. An unknown x is sampled uniformly at random from a concept class X, and a learning algorithm tries to uncover x by seeing streaming of random samples (ai, bi = M(ai, x)) where for every i, ai∈ A is chosen uniformly at random. Assume that k,ℓ,r are integers such that any submatrix of M of at least 2−k·|A| rows and at least 2−ℓ·|X| columns, has a bias of at most 2−r. We prove that any algorithm with classical and quantum hybrid memory for the learning problem corresponding to M needs either (1) Ω(k · ℓ) bits of classical memory, or (2) Ω(r) qubits of quantum memory, or (3) 2Ω(r) random samples, to achieve a success probability at least 2−O(r).         Our results refute the possibility that a small amount of quantum memory significantly reduces the size of classical memory needed for efficient learning on these problems. Our results also imply improved security of several existing cryptographical protocols in the bounded-storage model (protocols that are based on parity learning on n bits), proving that security holds even in the presence of a quantum adversary with at most c n2 bits of classical memory and c n bits of quantum memory (for some constant c&gt;0).",[N],N/A

When working with feature models, it is possible to analyze them, for instance, by counting the number of valid configurations, searching feature model anomalies, or creating samples of configurations for testing. Classical feature model analysis techniques are based on solving algorithmic problems such as boolean satisfiability, satisfiability modulo theories, or integer linear programming. Existing analysis approaches provide satisfactory solutions for small and medium-sized problem instances, but scaling issues are observed for large-sized feature models. Quantum computers provide up to superpolynomial speedups for specific algorithmic problems and have the potential to solve those scaling issues. This paper analyzes the algorithmic techniques used in classical product line analysis and identifies potentials and challenges for quantum speedups.

VQAs find near-optimal solutions in the presence of qubit errors by classically optimizing a loss function computed by parameterized quantum circuits. However, developing and testing VQAs is challenging due to the limited availability of quantum hardware, their high error rates, and the significant overhead of classical simulations. Furthermore, VQA researchers must pick the right initialization for circuit parameters, utilize suitable classical optimizer configurations, and deploy appropriate error mitigation methods. Unfortunately, these tasks are done in an ad-hoc manner today, as there are no software tools to configure and tune the VQA hyperparameters.In this paper, we present OSCAR (cOmpressed Sensing based Cost lAndscape Reconstruction) to help configure: 1) correct initialization, 2) noise mitigation techniques, and 3) classical optimizers to maximize the quality of the solution on NISQ hardware. OSCAR enables efficient debugging and performance tuning by providing users with the loss function landscape without running thousands of quantum circuits as required by the grid search. Using OSCAR, we can accurately reconstruct the complete cost landscape with up to 100X speedup.

In particular, we present a version of the well-known neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) algorithm and adapt it to the case of variational quantum circuits. We refer to the proposed architecture search algorithm for VQC as QNEAT.

Systems under test (SUTs) that take in programming or formal language as inputs, e.g., compilers, runtime engines, constraint solvers, and software libraries with accessible APIs, are especially important as they are fundamental building blocks of software development. However, existing fuzzers for such systems often target a specific language, and thus cannot be easily applied to other languages or even other versions of the same language. Moreover, the inputs generated by existing fuzzers are often limited to specific features of the input language, and thus can hardly reveal bugs related to other or new features. This paper presents Fuzz4ALL, the first fuzzer that is universal in the sense that it can target many different input languages and many different features of these languages. The key idea behind Fuzz4ALL is to leverage large language models (LLMs) as an input generation and mutation engine, which enables the approach to produce diverse and realistic inputs for any practically relevant language. To realize this potential, we present a novel autoprompting technique, which creates LLM prompts that are well- suited for fuzzing, and a novel LLM-powered fuzzing loop, which iteratively updates the prompt to create new fuzzing inputs. We evaluate Fuzz4ALL on nine systems under test that take in six different languages (C, C++, Go, SMT2, Java, and Python) as inputs. The evaluation shows, across all six languages, that universal fuzzing achieves higher coverage than existing, language-specific fuzzers. Furthermore, Fuzz4ALL has identified 98 bugs in widely used systems, such as GCC, Clang, Z3, CVC5, OpenJDK, and the Qiskit quantum computing platform, with 64 bugs already confirmed by developers as previously unknown.",[Y],[N]

Despite this growth, the existing classical simulators pose challenges in simulating large quantum operations due to the exponential growth of memory and computation resources required. To overcome these issues, some studies have explored the use of non-volatile memory, such as solid-state disks (SSDs), to store a large amount of state vector while maintaining cost efficiency. However, such highly frequent read-and-write operations in large quantum simulations can quickly deplete the lifespan of SSDs, leading to overestimated practical efficiency and environmental concerns. Alternatively, Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) can be used to expand memory capacity, allowing computers in a network to access remote memories with low latency and high bandwidth. Therefore, we propose using one-sided RDMA operations along with a series of optimizations to expand memory capacity and efficiently maximize the utilization of unused memory assets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approaches can be practically scaled up without any lifespan consumption. The proposed optimization can get a 3.0x speedup compared to the local memory approach and a maximum speedup of 2.0x compared to the naive RDMA-based approach, as observed in our benchmark test.",[N],N/A

Given an n-qubit pure quantum state |ψ⟩ that has fidelity at least τ with some stabilizer state, we give an algorithm that outputs a succinct description of a stabilizer state that witnesses fidelity at least τ − ε. The algorithm uses O(n/(ε2τ4)) samples and exp(O(n/τ4)) / ε2 time. In the regime of τ constant, this algorithm estimates stabilizer fidelity substantially faster than the naive exp(O(n2))-time brute-force algorithm over all stabilizer states.  In the special case of τ &gt; cos2(π/8), we show that a modification of the above algorithm runs in polynomial time.  We exhibit a tolerant property testing algorithm for stabilizer states.

To locate the bug, the quantum program is divided into several segments, and each segment is tested. However, to prepare a quantum state that is input to a segment, it is necessary to execute all the segments ahead of that segment in a quantum computer. This means that the cost of testing each segment depends on its location. We can also locate a buggy segment only if it is confirmed that there are no bugs in all segments ahead of that buggy segment. Since a quantum program is tested statistically on the basis of measurement results, there is a tradeoff between testing accuracy and cost. Although these characteristics are unique to quantum programs and complicate locating bugs, they have not been investigated. We suggest for the first time that these characteristics should be considered to efficiently locate bugs. We are also the first to propose a bug-locating method that takes these characteristics into account. The results from experiments indicate that the bug-locating cost, represented as the number of executed quantum gates, can be reduced with the proposed method compared with naive methods.",[Y],[Y]

In over 140 years of fingerprint analysis, no two fingerprints have ever been found to be identical, even in identical twins. Each of us is born with a unique set of fingerprints, although experts still don’t know with what exactly what we use them for. In information technology terms, biometrics is associated with technologies and techniques designed to secure and confirm identity based on individual, measurable biological characteristics of the person. Fingerprints can be used in systems and schemes designed to gain access to a computer, a room and, why not, a bank account. A verification system authenticates the person’s claimed identity by comparing the fingerprints provided by the person at a given point in time with the measures of these features previously stored in the system and associated with the person’s claimed identity. This paper presents a quantum matching algorithm for biometric fingerprints. For this, classical fingerprinting was encoded into quantum states using an adapted Novel Enhanced Quantum model and the quantum circuits, for storage and for matching, were implemented and tested on the IBM Quantum Experience platform and on a local virtual quantum simulator.",[N],N/A

Unfortunately, the conventional mechanism for grading programming assignments (running students' code on multiple test cases and verifying the output) is impractical for quantum computing. Scalable quantum computers are unlikely to be available for at least the next several years, and all known methods of simulating their behavior require exponential time.In this work, we present an efficient autograding methodology for quantum programs predicated on two observations: 1) there already exist efficient average-case methods for comparing two implementations of a quantum function for equivalency, and 2) most student submissions for an assignment are functionally identical to at least one previous submission. Our autograder maintains a database of previous submissions and iteratively compares incoming ones against this database. If no matches are found, a series of expensive simulations are performed to assign a score, and the submission along with its grade is added to the database. In the more common case of a hit, the matching score is automatically applied without the need for simulation.In a case study involving an undergraduate quantum computing course, our approach reduced total execution time needed to grade student submissions by 90% when compared to traditional autograding methods while maintaining the same granularity of feedback. We also show that our system demonstrates the largest speedups when under maximum stress, acting as a load balancer and reducing the percentage that hardware must be overprovisioned to handle the maximum load by 20%, yielding a total reduction of 92%.",[N],N/A

The T-Complexity Costs of Error Correction for Control Flow in Quantum Computation,"Yuan, Charles and Carbin, Michael",2024.0,10.1145/3656397,Proc. ACM Program. Lang.,https://doi.org/10.1145/3656397,Association for Computing Machinery,"Numerous quantum algorithms require the use of quantum error correction to overcome the intrinsic unreliability of physical qubits. However, quantum error correction imposes a unique performance bottleneck, known as T-complexity, that can make an implementation of an algorithm as a quantum program run more slowly than on idealized hardware. In this work, we identify that programming abstractions for control flow, such as the quantum if-statement, can introduce polynomial increases in the T-complexity of a program. If not mitigated, this slowdown can diminish the computational advantage of a quantum algorithm.To enable reasoning about the costs of control flow, we present a cost model that a developer can use to accurately analyze the T-complexity of a program under quantum error correction and pinpoint the sources of slowdown. To enable the mitigation of these costs, we present a set of program-level optimizations that a developer can use to rewrite a program to reduce its T-complexity, predict the T-complexity of the optimized program using the cost model, and then compile it to an efficient circuit via a straightforward strategy.We implement the program-level optimizations in Spire, an extension of the Tower quantum compiler. Using a set of 11 benchmark programs that use control flow, we empirically show that the cost model is accurate, and that Spire's optimizations recover programs that are asymptotically efficient, meaning their runtime T-complexity under error correction is equal to their time complexity on idealized hardware.Our results show that optimizing a program before it is compiled to a circuit can yield better results than compiling the program to an inefficient circuit and then invoking a quantum circuit optimizer found in prior work. For our benchmarks, only 2 of 8 tested quantum circuit optimizers recover circuits with asymptotically efficient T-complexity. Compared to these 2 optimizers, Spire uses 54\texttimes{}−2400\texttimes{} less compile time.",[N],N/A

Recently, QNN systems have been found to manifest robustness issues similar to classical DL systems. There is an urgent need for ways to test their correctness and security. However, QNN systems differ significantly from traditional quantum software and classical DL systems, posing critical challenges for QNN testing. These challenges include the inapplicability of traditional quantum software testing methods to QNN systems due to differences in programming paradigms and decision logic representations, the dependence of quantum test sample generation on perturbation operators, and the absence of effective information in quantum neurons. In this article, we propose QuanTest, a quantum entanglement-guided adversarial testing framework to uncover potential erroneous behaviors in QNN systems. We design a quantum entanglement adequacy criterion to quantify the entanglement acquired by the input quantum states from the QNN system, along with two similarity metrics to measure the proximity of generated quantum adversarial examples to the original inputs. Subsequently, QuanTest formulates the problem of generating test inputs that maximize the quantum entanglement adequacy and capture incorrect behaviors of the QNN system as a joint optimization problem and solves it in a gradient-based manner to generate quantum adversarial examples. Experimental results demonstrate that QuanTest possesses the capability to capture erroneous behaviors in QNN systems (generating 67.48–96.05% more high-quality test samples than the random noise under the same perturbation size constraints).

Syst.,https://doi.org/10.1145/3689333,Association for Computing Machinery,"Quantum circuit testing is essential for detecting potential faults in realistic quantum devices, while the testing process itself also suffers from the inexactness and unreliability of quantum operations. This article alleviates the issue by proposing a novel framework of automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) for robust testing of logical quantum circuits. We introduce the stabilizer projector decomposition (SPD) for representing the quantum test pattern and construct the test application (i.e., state preparation and measurement) using Clifford-only circuits, which are rather robust and efficient as evidenced in the fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, it is generally hard to generate SPDs due to the exponentially growing number of the stabilizer projectors. To circumvent this difficulty, we develop an SPD generation algorithm, as well as several acceleration techniques that can exploit both locality and sparsity in generating SPDs. The effectiveness of our algorithms are validated by (1) theoretical guarantees under reasonable conditions and (2) experimental results on commonly used benchmark circuits, such as Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), Quantum Volume (QV), and Bernstein-Vazirani (BV) in IBM Qiskit.",[Y],[Y]

Statistical Testing of Quantum Programs via Fixed-Point Amplitude Amplification,"Kang, Chan Gu and Lee, Joonghoon and Oh, Hakjoo",2024.0,10.1145/3689716,Proc. ACM Program. Lang.,https://doi.org/10.1145/3689716,Association for Computing Machinery,"We present a new technique for accelerating quantum program testing. Given a quantum circuit with an input/output specification, our goal is to check whether executing the program on the input state produces the expected output. In quantum computing, however, it is impossible to directly check the equivalence of the two quantum states. Instead, we rely on statistical testing, which involves repeated program executions, state measurements, and subsequent comparisons with the specified output. To guarantee a high level of assurance, however, this method requires an extensive number of measurements. In this paper, we propose a solution to alleviate this challenge by adapting Fixed-Point Amplitude Amplification (FPAA) for quantum program testing.

However, the current quantum software testing methods face practical limitations when applied in industrial contexts: (i) they do not apply to quantum programs most relevant to the industry, (ii) they require a full program specification, which is usually not available for these programs, and (iii) they are incompatible with error mitigation methods currently adopted by main industry actors like IBM. To address these challenges, we present QOPS, a novel quantum software testing approach. QOPS introduces a new definition of test cases based on Pauli strings to improve compatibility with different quantum programs. QOPS also introduces a new test oracle that can be directly integrated with industrial APIs such as IBM’s Estimator API and can utilize error mitigation methods for testing on real noisy quantum computers. We also leverage the commuting property of Pauli strings to relax the requirement of having complete program specifications, making QOPS practical for testing complex quantum programs in industrial settings. We empirically evaluate QOPS on 194,982 real quantum programs, demonstrating effective performance in test assessment compared to the state-of-the-art with a perfect F1-score, precision, and recall. Furthermore, we validate the industrial applicability of QOPS by assessing its performance on IBM’s three real quantum computers, incorporating both industrial and open-source error mitigation methods.CCS Concepts• Software and its engineering → Correctness; • Theory of computation → Quantum computation theory; • Computer systems organization → Quantum computing",[Y],[Y]

As with any compiler, transformation correctness is paramount as the machine readable code must maintain program semantics. Quantum programs are challenging to test given a lack of benchmark programs and the difficulty of defining an oracle. MorphQ solves both of these challenges by (1) generating syntactically correct quantum programs and (2) using metamorphic testing to avoid the oracle problem. However, Qiskit, the compiler it was built for, is rapidly evolving. This paper is a reproducibility study of the MorphQ platform, which we call MorphQ++. We have updated the core MorphQ engine to work on a newer version of Qiskit and added new metamorphic transformations. We find that our overall results are similar: we find a portion of the original faults (which were not yet fixed) and the distributions of types are not very different. Our new transformations lead to several new faults, suggesting there is room to expand the core framework. Additionally, we note the lack of power of the metamorphic relations in this context and suggest the need for more sophisticated relations and/or oracle evaluations.CCS CONCEPTS• Software and its engineering → Software testing and debugging, • Hardware → Quantum technologies.",[Y],[N]

This research addresses the disparity between these rapidly progressing technologies and the lack of advanced cybersecurity systems in nearly half of all American small businesses by creating accessible malware detection software on Google Colaboratory, a cloud-based software hosting service. Neural networks (NN), a common machine learning model for cybersecurity tasks, were created with both classical and simulated quantum computing using Python libraries, starter code, and an Android malware dataset. The average F1 score of accuracy of the classical NN, 0.6928, was slightly higher than the average F1 score of the quantum NN, 0.6406. However, a two-sample t-test found that the true means of both populations of F1 scores were statistically equal, indicating no difference in accuracy between classical and simulated quantum neural networks at this time. Differences in resource efficiency could not accurately be assessed, because although the quantum neural network was simulated on a classical computer and had a much higher runtime, a quantum neural network running on a quantum computer can be significantly faster than a classical neural network running on a classical computer for certain types of problems; this is because of unique quantum properties like superposition and entanglement that allow complex calculations to be performed much more efficiently. This research does find, however, that features related to the services or transactions of Android applications had higher correlations with malicious/benign software status, the change in runtime of a classical NN on Google Colaboratory was roughly linear over a large range of sample sizes, and two iterations of text segments and comments within the software improved the usability of the tool. Overall, the study develops a methodology for creating and evaluating open-source quantum and classical machine learning cybersecurity software for small businesses.",[N],N/A

Objective: This paper presents an empirical study focused on the testing of quantum software at its classical layer.

Results: Our findings reveal a high dispersion of test smells of 51% in quantum software. Furthermore, quantum tests exhibit statistical differences from classical software tests, with the most outlier being Conditional Test Logic, which is 20% more frequent than in classical software.

Softw. Eng. Methodol.,https://doi.org/10.1145/3714468,Association for Computing Machinery,"Quantum computing (QC) promises polynomial and exponential speedups in many domains, such as unstructured search and prime number factoring. However, quantum programs yield probabilistic outputs from exponentially growing distributions and are vulnerable to quantum-specific faults. Existing quantum software testing (QST) approaches treat quantum superpositions as classical distributions. This leads to two major limitations when applied to quantum programs: (1) an exponentially growing sample space distribution and (2) failing to detect quantum-specific faults such as phase flips. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a QST approach, which applies a reduction algorithm to a quantum program specification. The reduced specification alleviates the limitations (1) by enabling faster sampling through quantum parallelism and (2) by performing projective measurements in the mixed Hadamard basis. Our evaluation of 143 quantum programs across four categories demonstrates significant improvements in test runtimes and fault detection with our reduction approach. Average test runtimes improved from 169.9 s to 11.8 s, with notable enhancements in programs with large circuit depths (383.1 s to 33.4 s) and large program specifications (464.8 s to 7.7 s). Furthermore, our approach increases mutation scores from  (54.5%)  to  (74.7%) , effectively detecting phase flip faults that non-reduced specifications miss. These results underline our approach's importance to improve QST efficiency and effectiveness.",[Y],[Y]

ACM Softw. Eng.,https://doi.org/10.1145/3715751,Association for Computing Machinery,"Quantum programs provide exponential speedups compared to classical programs in certain areas, but they also inevitably encounter logical faults. Automatically repairing quantum programs is much more challenging than repairing classical programs due to the non-replicability of data, the vast search space of program inputs, and the new programming paradigm. Existing works based on semantic-based or learning-based program repair techniques are fundamentally limited in repairing efficiency and effectiveness. In this work, we propose HornBro, an efficient framework for automated quantum program repair. The key insight of HornBro lies in the homotopy-like method, which iteratively switches between the classical and quantum parts. This approach allows the repair tasks to be efficiently offloaded to the most suitable platforms, enabling a progressive convergence toward the correct program. We start by designing an implication assertion pragma to enable rigorous specifications of quantum program behavior, which helps to generate a quantum test suite automatically. This suite leverages the orthonormal bases of quantum programs to accommodate different encoding schemes. Given a fixed number of test cases, it allows the maximum input coverage of potential counter-example candidates. Then, we develop a Clifford approximation method with an SMT-based search to transform the patch localization program into a symbolic reasoning problem. Finally, we offload the computationally intensive repair of gate parameters to quantum hardware by leveraging the differentiability of quantum gates. Experiments suggest that HornBro increases the repair success rate by more than 62.5% compared to the existing repair techniques, supporting more types of quantum bugs. It also achieves 35.7\texttimes{} speedup in the repair and 99.9% gate reduction of the patch.",[Y],[Y]

One key concern in the QML domain is the threat of data poisoning attacks in the current quantum cloud setting. Adversarial access to training data could severely compromise the integrity and availability of QML models. Classical data poisoning techniques require significant knowledge and training to generate poisoned data, and lack noise resilience, making them ineffective for QML models in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. In this work, we first propose a simple yet effective technique to measure intra-class encoder state similarity (ESS) by analyzing the outputs of encoding circuits. Leveraging this approach, we introduce a Quantum Indiscriminate Data Poisoning attack, QUID. Through extensive experiments conducted in both noiseless and noisy environments (e.g., IBM_Brisbane’s noise), across various architectures and datasets, QUID achieves up to ( 92% ) accuracy degradation in model performance compared to baseline models and up to ( 75% ) accuracy degradation compared to random label-flipping. We also tested QUID against state-of-the-art classical defenses, with accuracy degradation still exceeding ( 50% ), demonstrating its effectiveness.

We give a polynomial-time quantum algorithm which can find the cut using O(n/є2) many copies of the state, which is optimal up to logarithmic factors. Our algorithm also generalizes to learn the entanglement structure of arbitrary product states. In the special case of Haar-random states, we further show that our algorithm requires circuits of only constant depth. To develop our algorithm, we introduce a state generalization of the hidden subgroup problem (StateHSP) which might be of independent interest, in which one is given a quantum state invariant under an unknown subgroup action, with the goal of learning the hidden symmetry subgroup. We show how the hidden cut problem can be formulated as a StateHSP with a carefully chosen Abelian group action. We then prove that Fourier sampling on the hidden cut state produces similar outcomes as a variant of the well-known Simon’s problem, allowing us to find the hidden cut efficiently. Therefore, our algorithm can be interpreted as an extension of Simon’s algorithm to entanglement testing.

Our construction provides the first known codes with low-weight stabilizers that are capable of magic state distillation with arbitrarily small yield parameter γ=log(N/K)/log(D)&gt;0.  A classical analogue of transversal Cr−1Z gates is given by the multiplication property, which requires component-wise products of classical codewords to belong to another similar code. As a byproduct of our techniques, we also obtain a new construction of classical locally testable codes with such a multiplication property.  We construct our codes as products of chain complexes associated to classical LDPC codes, which in turn we obtain by imposing local Reed-Solomon codes on a specific spectral expander that we construct.

In this paper, we study the problem of testing how close or far a quantum state is to a stabilizer state. We make two contributions: First, we improve the state-of-the-art parameters for the tolerant testing of stabilizer states. In particular, we show that there is an efficient quantum primitive to distinguish if the maximum fidelity of a quantum state with a stabilizer state is ≥ є1 or ≤ є2, given one of them is the case, provided that є2 ≤ є1O(1). This result improves the parameters in the previous work which assumed є2 ≤ e− 1/є1O(1). Our proof technique extends the toolsets developed in before by applying a random Clifford map which balances the characteristic function of a quantum state, enabling the use of standard proof techniques from higher-order Fourier analysis for Boolean functions, where improved testing bounds are available. Second, we study the problem of testing low stabilizer rank states. We show that if for an infinite family of quantum states stabilizer rank is lower than a constant independent of system size, then stabilizer fidelity is lower bounded by an absolute constant. Using a result on estimating stabilizer fidelity of quantum states, one of the implications of this result is that low approximate stabilizer rank states are not pseudo-random.",[N],N/A

Methodol.,https://doi.org/10.1145/3736757,Association for Computing Machinery,"Due to the growing demand for high-quality quantum programs (QPs), unit testing is employed to check the behavior of QPs. As for quantum inputs of testing, most studies limit test inputs to pure states, whereas mixed states representing probabilistic mixtures of pure states are almost excluded from the test process. Besides, when achieving the input domain coverage, lots of pure-state test cases (PSTCs) with pure states as inputs should be employed, leading to high time costs for testing. To handle that, this article explores using mixed states as test inputs for better utilization of quantum information. From the perspective of input domain coverage, applying mixed-state test cases (MSTCs) replacing PSTCs can simplify the test suite and accordingly promote test efficiency. Owing to the mixture of multiple pure states, a single MSTC is more likely to detect a fault than a PSTC, thereby enhancing test effectiveness. This article then proposes a unit testing framework, including generation and execution of MSTCs. Also, this article presents two guidelines and two parameterized quantum circuits to prepare desired mixed states.

While promising prior work has investigated ways to exploit   sparsity, it is still unclear what is the best way to scale sparse simulation to modern multi-core architectures.    In this work, we address this challenge and present qblaze, a highly optimized sparse state vector simulator   based on (i) a compact sorted array representation, and (ii) new, easily parallelizable and highly-scalable   algorithms for all quantum operations. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that qblaze is often   orders-of-magnitude more efficient than prior sparse state vector simulators even on a single thread, and also   that qblaze scales well to a large number of CPU cores.    Overall, our work enables testing quantum algorithms on input sizes that were previously out of reach.",[N],N/A
Shaking Up Quantum Simulators with Fuzzing and Rigour,"Klimis, Vasileios and Bensoussan, Avner and Chachkarova, Elena and Even-Mendoza, Karine and Fortz, Sophie and Lenihan, Connor",2025.0,10.1145/3763100,Proc. ACM Program. Lang.,https://doi.org/10.1145/3763100,Association for Computing Machinery,"Quantum computing platforms rely on simulators for modelling circuit behaviour prior to hardware execution, where inconsistencies can lead to costly errors. While existing formal validation methods typically target specific compiler components to manage state explosion, they often miss critical bugs. Meanwhile, conventional testing lacks systematic exploration of corner cases and realistic execution scenarios, resulting in both false positives and negatives.    We present FuzzQ, a novel framework that bridges this gap by combining formal methods with structured test generation and fuzzing for quantum simulators.   Our approach employs differential benchmarking complemented by mutation testing and invariant checking. At its core, FuzzQ utilises our Alloy-based formal model of QASM 3.0, which encodes the semantics of quantum circuits to enable automated analysis and to generate structurally diverse, constraint-guided quantum circuits with guaranteed properties.   We introduce several test oracles to assess both Alloy’s modelling of QASM 3.0 and simulator correctness, including invariant-based checks, statistical distribution tests, and a novel cross-simulator unitary consistency check that verifies functional equivalence modulo global phase, revealing discrepancies that standard statevector comparisons fail to detect in cross-platform differential testing.    We evaluate FuzzQ on both Qiskit and Cirq, demonstrating its platform-agnostic effectiveness. By executing over 800,000 quantum circuits to completion, we assess throughput, code and circuit coverage, and simulator performance metrics, including sensitivity, correctness, and memory overhead. Our analysis revealed eight simulator bugs, six previously undocumented. We also outline a path for extending the framework to support mixed-state simulations under realistic noise models.",[Y],[N]

Among these, the Quantum Neural Network (QNN) stands out as one of the promising algorithms that integrates the principles of quantum computing with artificial neural networks to process data. Inspired by applications of QNN across fields, we investigate their use in software testing for the Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN), part of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH), responsible for cancer statistics among the Norwegian population. CRN develops a complex socio-technical software system, Cancer Registration Support System ( (mathtt{CaReSS}) ), interacting with many entities (e.g., hospitals, medical laboratories, and other patient registries) to achieve its task. For cost-effective testing of  (mathtt{CaReSS}) , CRN has employed  (mathtt{EvoMaster}) , an AI-based REST API testing tool combined with an integrated classical machine learning model  (mathtt{EvoClass}) .

Complexity-theoretic foundations of quantum supremacy experiments,"Aaronson, Scott and Chen, Lijie",2017.0,,Proceedings of the 32nd Computational Complexity Conference,,Schloss Dagstuhl--Leibniz-Zentrum fuer Informatik,"In the near future, there will likely be special-purpose quantum computers with 40--50 high-quality qubits. This paper lays general theoretical foundations for how to use such devices to demonstrate ""quantum supremacy"": that is, a clear quantum speedup for some task, motivated by the goal of overturning the Extended Church-Turing Thesis as confidently as possible.First, we study the hardness of sampling the output distribution of a random quantum circuit, along the lines of a recent proposal by the Quantum AI group at Google. We show that there's a natural average-case hardness assumption, which has nothing to do with sampling, yet implies that no polynomial-time classical algorithm can pass a statistical test that the quantum sampling procedure's outputs do pass. Compared to previous work -- for example, on BosonSampling and IQP -- the central advantage is that we can now talk directly about the observed outputs, rather than about the distribution being sampled.Second, in an attempt to refute our hardness assumption, we give a new algorithm, inspired by Savitch's Theorem, for simulating a general quantum circuit with n qubits and depth d in polynomial space and dO(n) time. We then discuss why this and other known algorithms fail to refute our assumption.Third, resolving an open problem of Aaronson and Arkhipov, we show that any strong quantum supremacy theorem -- of the form ""if approximate quantum sampling is classically easy, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses""-- must be non-relativizing. This sharply contrasts with the situation for exact sampling.Fourth, refuting a conjecture by Aaronson and Ambainis, we show that there is a sampling task, namely Fourier Sampling, with a 1 versus linear separation between its quantum and classical query complexities.Fifth, in search of a ""happy medium"" between black-box and non-black-box arguments, we study quantum supremacy relative to oracles in P/poly. Previous work implies that, if one-way functions exist, then quantum supremacy is possible relative to such oracles. We show, conversely, that some computational assumption is needed: if SampBPP = SampBQP and NP ⊆ BPP, then quantum supremacy is impossible relative to oracles with small circuits.",[N],N/A

Our fault models are based on real physical phenomenon of quantum dot devices so that they represent real defect behavior or control errors. Our fault simulation does not need to fully expand gate matrices to 2n x 2n, where n is the number of qubits. Using sparse matrix multiplication, our fault simulation saves a lot of memory and CPU time. We also calculate the test repetition of each test pattern so that we can estimate our test time.

But the complexity of these methods is very sensitive to so-called contraction plans or simulation paths, respectively, which define the order in which respective operations are applied. While, for tensor networks, a plethora of strategies has been developed, simulation based on decision diagrams is mostly conducted in a straight-forward fashion thus far. In this work, we envision a flow that allows to translate strategies from the domain of tensor networks to decision diagrams.

Beyond the Pixels: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Image Analysis in Astronomy --- Poster Abstract,"Granucci, Nicole and Jaiswal, Chetan",2024.0,,J. Comput. Sci. Coll.,,Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges,"Interdisciplinary collaboration between computer science and astronomy is critical for new discoveries as it brings together the expertise of two distinct yet complementary fields. The vast and complex datasets generated by astronomical observations require sophisticated computational methods for analysis and interpretation. Computer scientists contribute their skills in algorithm development, data processing, and artificial intelligence whereas astronomers provide unique challenges and insights that push the boundaries of computer science applications. This collaboration offers a multifaceted learning experience for students beyond disciplinary boundaries. This approach encourages a diverse skill set development, promotes creativity, critical thinking, and adaptability. It provides students with real-world applications for their theoretical knowledge, preparing them for careers that demand cross-disciplinary collaboration. It also instills a collaborative mindset that is increasingly essential in today's interconnected scientific landscape. Our intent is to develop a baseline model and then involve students during the summer research experience program. We also foresee developing a Computer Science-Physics cross listed undergraduate course for enriching student experience who are interested in these two disciplines. In this study, we will present our work in progress towards developing open-source software for astronomy image study and analysis. The flexibility of open-source development combined with a culture of innovation, leads to rapid improvements and the introduction of cutting-edge features. This software would provide a transparent mode for non-programmer users to not only view, stack, and overlay the raw image capture(s) but also do basic photometry and image statistics. The work in progress also involves the study of unsupervised learning to perform clustering analysis of the raw image capture(s). This analysis would group pixels or regions with similar characteristics, uncovering structures such as globular clusters, galaxies, or binary star systems. This process helps discern spatial relationships, identify outliers, and distinguish different celestial objects based on their inherent properties, such as brightness and shape. We are testing our open-source software with image data from a college telescope from Southern Connecticut State University. The telescope is a Spica Eyes Dobsonian reflecting telescope with an aperture size of 0.6m and focal ratio f/3.3. Transfer optics were added to increased our spatial resolution from 1.4 arcsec per pixel to 0.8 arcsec per pixel measurement. The transfer optics used a filter λ0 = 537nm that optimized quantum efficiency in the V-band. These images were taken July 2018 at Southern Connecticut State University (SCSU) in New Haven, CT where there is high artificial brightness and Bortle scale of 8. These images were taken in poor seeing conditions since the humidity was high due to the typical nature of costal Connecticut in the summer. Furthermore, tracking was not stable leading to target drift across the image plane. Figure 1(a) shows images from this observation session which include 8 frames of 0.05s exposure time with a readout speed of 2MHz of Jupiter. This shows how tracking and poor alignment can lead to images that are not resolved to show the details of Jupiter as seen in Figure 1(b). Stacking is necessary to improve the signal to noise ratio of the images as well as smooth out details. Without sufficient stacking, it will be difficult to distinguish details of the images.",[N],N/A
Can Quantum Computing Improve Uniform Random Sampling of Large Configuration Spaces?,"Ammermann, Joshua and Bittner, Tim and Eichhorn, Domenik and Schaefer, Ina and Seidl, Christoph",2023.0,10.1109/Q-SE59154.2023.00012,2023 IEEE/ACM 4th International Workshop on Quantum Software Engineering (Q-SE),,,"A software product line models the variability of highly configurable systems. Complete exploration of all valid configurations (the configuration space) is infeasible as it grows exponentially with the number of features in the worst case. In practice, few representative configurations are sampled instead, which may be used for software testing or hardware verification. Pseudo-randomness of modern computers introduces statistical bias into these samples. Quantum computing enables truly random, uniform configuration sampling based on inherently random quantum physical effects. We propose a method to encode the entire configuration space in a superposition and then measure one random sample. We show the method's uniformity over multiple samples and investigate its scale for different feature models. We discuss the possibilities and limitations of quantum computing for uniform random sampling regarding current and future quantum hardware.",[N],N/A

This software testing of a QNN via dynamic analysis is essentially required due to undetermined probabilistic qubit states during runtime operations. Furthermore, an EQuaTE is capable of visual feedback because the barren plateaus can be identified at local autonomous driving platforms, and the corresponding information will be visualized at remotely connected cloud. Based on this visualized information at the cloud, the QNN, which is also stored at cloud, should be automatically reorganized and retrained for eliminating barren plateaus. Then, the trained parameters can be downloaded into the QNN of autonomous driving platforms.",[N],N/A

Herein lies the field of distributed quantum computing optimized for large-scale communication. One such system that has been designed is the Quantum Message Passing Interface (QMPI). This interface, unlike the classical MPI, takes advantage of quantum teleportation to communicate between different quantum nodes but leverages the framework built for classical MPI.

Besides, the input space of quantum programs may exponentially grow when the number of qubits increases, posing great challenges to testing quantum programs. It is imperative to develop a proper testing strategy to effectively select the potential failure-causing test cases and detect faults faster. In this paper, test cases with both basis states and superposition ones are considered and generated to cover more input space. A hybrid distance measurement method based on quantum fidelity and Hamming distance is presented for measuring the similarity among quantum test cases.

The post quantum digital signature technique CRYSTALS-Dilithium, which was standardized by NIST, serves as the foundation for the quantum-resistant blind signature scheme, CDBS, presented in this study. This system is appropriate for a variety of Internet application scenarios, including e-ticketing, anonymous payments, and privacy protection, because it integrates the idea of blind signatures, which is not included in typical digital signature schemes. This scheme is designed to resist quantum computing attacks and is based on the post-quantum digital signature algorithm CRYSTALS-Dilithium, which NIST has selected. The whole technique utilizes the Fiat-Shamir signature structure, which consists of five stages: key creation, blinding, signing, unblinding, and verification. The security of the proposed scheme is dependent on the resolution of the Module Learning with Errors (MLWE) problem and the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem. Additionally, the scheme must satisfy the criteria of correctness, blindness, and unforgeability. According to the test results, the CRYSTALS-Dilithium scheme requires an average of  $401.89~\mu $  s for a single round of verification and signing. The CDBS technique takes an average of  $657.65~\mu $  s for one round of signing and verification since the blinding and unblinding modules are added on top of the original algorithm, increasing the algorithm’s complexity.

The Quantum Program Dependence Graph and its uses in Quantum Software Development,"Yu, Haibo and Zhao, Jianjun",2025.0,10.1109/Q-SE66736.2025.00014,2025 IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Quantum Software Engineering (Q-SE),,,"Quantum software is increasingly recognized as a critical component of quantum computing systems. As resources for quantum software design grow, the need for specialized tools and techniques to support quantum software development becomes more pressing. In this paper, we introduce the quantum program dependence graph (QPDG), a novel dependence analysis model specifically tailored for quantum software. The QPDG operates directly on the source code of quantum programs, capturing both classical and quantum-specific dependencies—namely, entanglement, no-cloning, temporal, and measurement dependencies—thus providing detailed insights into program dependencies at the code level. We further discuss key applications of QPDG, including quantum program slicing, comprehension, debugging, testing, maintenance, reuse, and complexity metrics, demonstrating its potential to enhance various aspects of quantum software engineering.",[N],N/A
Bridging the Quantum Divide: Aligning Academic and Industry Goals in Software Engineering,"Zappin, Jake and Stalnaker, Trevor and Chaparro, Oscar and Poshyvanyk, Denys",2025.0,10.1109/Q-SE66736.2025.00013,2025 IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Quantum Software Engineering (Q-SE),,,"This position paper examines the substantial divide between academia and industry within quantum software engineering. For example, while academic research related to debugging and testing predominantly focuses on a limited subset of primarily quantum-specific issues, industry practitioners face a broader range of practical concerns, including software integration, compatibility, and real-world implementation hurdles. This disconnect mainly arises due to academia's limited access to industry practices and the often confidential, competitive nature of quantum development in commercial settings. As a result, academic advancements often fail to translate into actionable tools and methodologies that meet industry needs. By analyzing discussions within quantum developer forums, we identify key gaps in focus and resource availability that hinder progress on both sides. We propose collaborative efforts aimed at developing practical tools, methodologies, and best practices to bridge this divide, enabling academia to address the application-driven needs of industry and fostering a more aligned, sustainable ecosystem for quantum software development.",[N],N/A
Quantum Computing is a Paradigm Shift—Time to Get Involved! [From the Editor],"Eldh, Sigrid",2025.0,10.1109/MS.2025.3579852,IEEE Software,,,"The ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) celebrated its 50th year in May 2025, and while I was there, I was fortunate to listen to Michael Hilton (Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), who suggested that, currently, the uncertainty of flaky tests was like the uncertainty of quantum computers. How should we handle this uncertainty or nondeterminism? Flaky tests are tests that give different results when executing the test suite, though the software has not changed. The comparison might not be exactly right, but it has a degree of similarity. Quantum can only solve quantum-framed problems, and not NP-complete problems (i.e., the hardest problems to be verified quickly). On the other hand, there are many published works examining flaky tests in quantum,1,2 as there is uncertainty in the results, even if the causes are rather different.",[N],N/A
A Framework for Debugging Quantum Programs,"Rovara, Damian and Burgholzer, Lukas and Wille, Robert",2025.0,10.1109/QSW67625.2025.00024,2025 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Software (QSW),https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11134329,IEEE Press,"Recent advancements in quantum computing software are gradually increasing the scope and size of quantum programs being developed. At the same time, however, these larger programs provide more possibilities for functional errors that are harder to detect and resolve. Meanwhile, debugging tools that could aid developers in resolving these errors are still barely existent and far from what we take for granted in classical design automation and software engineering. As a result, even if one manages to identify the incorrect behavior of a developed quantum program, detecting and resolving the underlying errors in the program remains a time-consuming and tedious task. Moreover, the exponential growth of the state space in quantum programs makes the efficient manual investigation of errors radically difficult even for respectively simple algorithms, and almost impossible as the number of qubits increases. To address this problem, this work proposes a debugging framework, available as an open-source implementation at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-debugger. It assists developers in debugging errors in quantum programs, allowing them to efficiently identify the existence of errors and diagnose their causes. Users are given the ability to place assertions in the code that test for the correctness of a given algorithm and are evaluated using classical simulations of the underlying quantum program. Once an assertion fails, the proposed framework employs different diagnostic methods to point towards possible error causes. This way, the debugging workload for quantum programs is drastically reduced.",[Y],[Y]

As a first step to developing a full quantum circuit debugger, we have designed and implemented a quantum circuit debugging tool. The tool allows the user to divide the circuit vertically or horizontally into smaller chunks known as slices, and manage their simulation or execution for either interactive debugging or automated testing. The tool also enables developers to track gates within the overall circuit and each chunk to understand their behavior better.

To further improve device performance, loss mechanisms must be identified and minimized. Triplet states are known to adversely affect device performance, since they can form energetically trapped excitons on low-lying states that are responsible for non-radiative losses or even device degradation. Halogenation of OPV materials has long been employed to tailor energy levels and to enhance open circuit voltage. Yet, the influence on recombination to triplet excitons has been largely unexplored. Using the complementary spin-sensitive methods of photoluminescence detected magnetic resonance and transient electron paramagnetic resonance corroborated by transient absorption and quantum-chemical calculations, exciton pathways in OPV blends are unravelled employing the polymer donors PBDB-T, PM6, and PM7 together with NFAs Y6 and Y7. All blends reveal triplet excitons on the NFA populated via non-geminate hole back transfer and, in blends with halogenated donors, also by spin-orbit coupling driven intersystem crossing.

These ligands are shown to form robust bonds especially with CQDs {100} facets, effectively maintaining surface passivation and suppressing CQDs fusion at high temperatures.

For the effective transfer of a huge amount of data between arithmetic and storage devices, optical communication technology represents a compelling solution. Here, by replicating a floating gate architecture with CdSe/ZnS type-I core/shell quantum dots (QDs), a 2D–0D hybrid optical multi-level memory (OMM) device operated is demonstrated by laser pulses. In the device, laser pulses create linear optically trapped currents with MM characteristics, while conversely, voltage pulses reset all the trapped currents at once. Assuming electron transfer via the energy band alignment between MoS2 and CdSe, the study also establishes the mechanism of the OMM effect. Analysis of the designed device led to a new hypothesis that charge transfer is difficult for laterally adjacent QDs facing a double ZnS shell, which is tested by separately stimulating different positions on the 2D–0D hybrid structure with finely focused laser pulses. Results indicate that each laser pulse induced independent MM characteristics in the 2D–0D hybrid architecture. Based on this phenomenon, we propose a MM inverter to produce MM effects, such as programming and erasing, solely through the use of laser pulses.

However, mainstream SWIR detection based on epitaxial photodiodes cannot effectively detect ultraweak infrared radiation due to the lack of inherent gain. Here, we develop a heterojunction-gated field-effect transistor (HGFET) consisting of a colloidal quantum dot (CQD)-based p-i-n heterojunction and a carbon nanotube (CNT) field-effect transistor, which achieves a high inherent gain based on an opto-electric decoupling mechanism for suppressing noise. The stacked heterojunction absorbs infrared radiation and separates electron–hole pairs. Then, the generated photovoltage tunes the drain current of the CNT FET through an Y2O3 gate insulator. As a result, the HGFET significantly detects and amplifies SWIR signals with a high inherent gain while minimally amplifying noise, leading to a recorded specific detectivity above 1014 Jones at 1300 nm and a recorded maximum gain-bandwidth product of 69.2 THz. Direct comparative testing indicates that the HGFET can detect weak infrared radiation at 0.46 nW cm−2 levels; thus, compared to commercial and reported SWIR detectors, this detector is much more sensitive and enables starlight detection or vision.

To address the requirements of integrating top-illuminated OPD with ROICs and to enhance the external quantum efficiency (EQE), optical microcavities are introduced into the OPDs. The EQE in the SWIR region can be effectively enhanced by properly adjusting the thicknesses of the photoactive layer (PAL) and interlayers. Simulations of the optical field distribution further support the active functions of the microcavity structure.

Most importantly it is shown that both, reduction as well as oxidation potentials can be precisely tuned with a gradual stepping of about 100 meV by changing the terminal groups attached to the DPP core. Exploiting this energy level modification, these materials are tested in planar cascade organic photovoltaic devices using C60 as acceptor. A sub nm thick interlayer of a suitable DPP derivative is introduced to obtain a distinct energy level cascade at the donor/acceptor interface. Power conversion efficiency as well as short-circuit current density is doubled with respect to the reference bilayer devices lacking the interface cascade. Spectrally resolved analysis of external quantum efficiency reveals that this enhancement can mainly be attributed to destabilization of bound charge transfer states formed in the C60 layer at the interlayer interface, thus reducing geminate recombination losses.",[N],N/A

Through meticulous adjustments in material compositions and device architectures, optimization enhances energy conversion efficiency, making solar power more competitive and adaptable across various applications. This article presents the optimization and efficiency enhancement of a ZnO/CdS/CIGS solar cell with GaAs. The optimization process utilizes the particle swarm optimization algorithm with a step-by-step approach. Solar cells are designed using SCAPS-1D software, and optimization is performed using Python. The optimized ZnO/CdS/CIGS solar cell achieves an efficiency of 32.4\%, which rises to 44.7\% upon integrating a GaAs layer. Further efficiency gains are observed, reaching 53.2\% through back contact optimization, providing a power density of 54 mW cm−2. Optimization also notices a significant improvement in quantum efficiency. The cells are tested under concentrated solar irradiance (1000–10 000 W m−2) and temperatures (300–800 K). Results show that at 10 000 W m−2 and 800 K, the ZnO/CdS/CIGS/GaAs cell requires 53.9\% less material than the ZnO/CdS/CIGS cell. Thus, adding GaAs enhances efficiency and thermal resilience, making it ideal for concentrated photovoltaics.",[N],N/A

MSUT-2 has emerged as a viable target for the treatment of tauopathies like Alzheimer's, as the protein's interactions with the tau protein could be central to the accumulation and aggregation of tau. Quantum Computing and Machine Learning are two developing fields that have the capability to completely revolutionize the field of pharmacology. Developed architectures like Quantum Support Vector Machines can be scaled up readily as technology improves, further enhancing this breakthrough field’s implications on pharmacology. Method In the first phase of research, OpenEye's FILTER software was employed, which eliminated a set of starting compounds from ChemBridge's EXPRESS-PICK Screening Library (over 500,000 compounds) that were predicted to be highly toxic and have low bioavailability. Next, a simple pharmacophore screen was performed using a set of known partial actives and inactives on OpenEye's ROCS tool. A modified Quantum Support Vector Machine algorithm was then run through IBM Qiskit. The model was trained using dozens of known chemical features of FDA-approved chemical actives and inactives. Compounds were featurized using data from SwissADME. Following preprocessing and training, the model was executed to predict known actives from the remaining set of test compounds. Finally, compounds were subject to a precise molecular docking trial with MSUT-2 (using OpenEye’s FRED tool and AUTODOCK Vina), where binding interaction strength was directly evaluated. Result This computational screening methodology resulted in numerous predicted inhibitors of MSUT-2. To validate the methodology of this screening workflow, numerous known FDA-approved drugs and actives for other diseases were successfully identified using the exact screening methodology utilized in this experiment through retrospective analysis. Conclusion In conclusion, a promising computational screening methodology partially validated with translational data using advancements in Quantum Machine Learning has been identified.

First, we derive transport coefficients which have recently been employed for testing generalized equilibrium conditions known as exchange fluctuation relations.

Raman spectroscopy identified a characteristic peak associated with oxygen vacancies, indicating defect formation. Thermogravimetric analysis showed a 4.97\% weight gain, likely due to the filling of oxygen vacancies at elevated temperatures. Transmission electron microscope revealed a nano hexagon morphology with an average particle size of 20 nm. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy analysis confirmed the presence of both cerium and nickel elements. Electronic structure calculations, performed using density functional theory via Quantum ESPRESSO, indicated that Ni doping introduces new 3d states into the CeO2 band structure, resulting in bandgap narrowing and a lowered Fermi level. Electrochemical testing demonstrated that NiCeO2 exhibits superior ORR performance compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts. Kinetic analysis suggested a near four-electron transfer pathway. Durability is assessed using chronoamperometry, showing that NiCeO2 retained 90\% of its initial current after 20 h of operation, outperforming Pt/C.

Thermal Vibration Correlation Function Formalism for Molecular Excited State Decay Rates,"Shuai, Zhigang",2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/cjoc.202000226,Chinese Journal of Chemistry,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cjoc.202000226,,"What is the most favorite and original chemistry developed in your research group? MOMAP, abbreviated for MOlecular MAterials Property prediction package, wherein the key function is the thermal vibration correlation function (TVCF) formalism for excited state decay, allowing theoretical prediction of light-emitting quantum efficiency and carrier mobility. MOMAP starts to be popular after its first launch in 2015. How do you get into this specific field? Could you please share some experiences with our readers? I was trained with theoretical condensed matter physics in Fudan University. At that time, physicists have strong interests in low-dimensional system because the particular phenomenon has been predicted due to dimensionality. Conducting polymers have been quite a hot topic in the early 80’s since exotic elementary excitations as soliton and polaron have been demonstrated in such systems. Then, the field more and more moved towards theoretical chemistry since the interest in physics was suddenly turned to high Tc superconductivity and fractional quantum Hall effect. My supervisor Prof. Xin Sun and I have kept the interests, ever since the beginning. So, after my PhD in Fudan university, I went to Belgium to work with Prof. Jean-Luc Bredas, a known theoretical chemist working in the same field. It should be noted that the basic concepts derived from conducting polymers such as spin-charge separation and fractional charge have been pivotal to understand the novel quantum phenomena such as strongly correlated electrons and topological excitations in novel quantum materials. But the field itself (organic and polymeric optoelectronics) has become interdisciplinary but predominantly chemistry research. And the theory part has expanded the theoretical chemistry scope. So, very naturally, I turned my self to be a theoretical chemist. How do you supervise your students? As for theoretical and computational chemistry group, it is imperial to develop their own computational methodology. Nevertheless, applicability is the value of methodology. Namely, the purpose of methodology is to be applied. Thus, it is equally important for the group to do application work, especially, to collaborate with experimental groups by using our own developed methods. So, all my students need to do computational work either to test the applicability of the methodology or to understand the structure-property for the newly discovered experimental findings, or to clarify some debates in understanding the mechanism/processes. Some of the students have interests in math and physics and in writing program codes. They are stronly encouraged to develop methodology. I am lucky that I do have some excellent students with both motivation and solid math/physics background. I believe they will do better science than me in the future. And I hope they will also establish their own brand. I will be happy for that. But I am also very happy that the students coming to my group with little theory background but after a few years hard working, they can demonstrate important applications of quantum chemistry and lead to interesting findings by computational study, and they continue their academic career in computational chemistry. What is the most important personality for scientific research? Persistence! Chance will come (though only occasionally) to persistent people. Being smart is far from enough. What's your hobbies? What's your favorite book(s)? Swimming and music (Rock of the 60s). I like《上帝掷骰子吗?量子物理史话》by曹天元and all the books by Louis Cha (金庸). How do you keep balance between research and family? When you are young, say, before 40, you have to work very hard to establish yourself. Sacrificing family life seems inevitable. After that, it is easy to make a balance. Who influences you mostly in your life? My high school physics teacher influenced me most. At the time when GaoKao (高考) was not available, there was hardly any serious class education except my physics teacher. Under his guidance, I spent only 6 months to learn and master four years high school curriculum and got into college: in our school that time, less than 2\% can get into college, let alone good university as Sun Yet-sen University. This changed my life. What is your favorite journal(s)? The Journal of Chemical Physics, Physical Review B, the Journal of Physical Chemistry (Letters), and more and more, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation. We theorists usually do not publish or recognize important work in general chemistry journal. Popular is not necessary important, especially for theoretical work. Most of the Nobel Prize works in physical or theoretical chemistry were published in J. Chem. Phys. or Chem. Phys. Lett. (with impact factors around 3). Could you please give us some advices on improving Chinese Journal of Chemistry? CJC is a general chemistry journal. Chemistry with broad interest should be the most important priority. Thus, methodology paper is usually of less audience unless it demonstrated broad applicability or possibilities to open new fields of applications. If you have anything else to tell our readers, please feel free to do so. Keeping in mind to do different science is the most important thing to do. “First” rather than “better” work is always the top priority. Excited state decay for complex molecules consists of one of the most challenging issues for theoretical chemistry. By virtue of fast Fourier transformation we developed a highly efficient thermal vibration correlation function formalism for the excited state radiative and non-radiative decay rates, which transformed the conventional Fermi-Golden Rule into a time-dependent formalism and the time-consuming exponential scaling summation over vibrational states has been converted to an N3 scaling matrix production algorithm combined with time integration. It allows vibration mode mixing (Duschinsky rotation) effect, pertinent for large and soft organic molecules. Another important feature is promoting- mode free, rendering this method quite general. By replacing the non-adiabatic coupling prefactor with intermolecular electronic coupling term, the same formalism can be applied to modeling the carrier mobility in organic semiconductors (which is not discussed in this work). It has been implemented in a portable computational program package MOMAP, which has been successfully applied by many groups for the investigations of organic functional materials, for example, for fluorescent and phosphorescent emission, aggregation induced emission (AIE) phenomena, sensoring process for bilogical and environmental processes, coordinate compounds, thermally activated delayed fluorescence, as well as organic room temperature phosphorescence.",[N],N/A
Device engineering of lead-free FaCsSnI3/Cs2AgBiI6-based dual-absorber perovskite solar cell architecture for powering next-generation wireless networks,"Baruah, Smriti and Borah, Janmoni and Reddy, Perugu Yaswanth and Sindhupriya, Chamarthi and Sathvika, Nara and Rajasekaran, Subramaniam",2024.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/dac.5903,International Journal of Communication Systems,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/dac.5903,,"Summary Solar-powered devices, such as wireless networks, are a crucial component of the Internet of Things (IoT). Designing and creating a solar cell architecture with an extended light absorption regime at a reasonable cost is therefore exceedingly important. All inorganic bismuth-based Cs2AgBiI6 planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered enormous significance due to their exceptional stability against oxygen, heat, and moisture. However, the power conversion efficiencies of Cs2AgBiI6-based planar PSCs remain relatively low, primarily due to their limited light absorption range and interfacial charge recombination losses. This issue can be effectively addressed using a novel multi-absorber architecture that incorporates dual absorbers with both lower band gap and wider band gap materials. This approach extends the light absorption range, enabling maximal utilization of the solar spectrum. Therefore, this article incorporates numerical modeling and guided optimization of ITO/ETL/Cs2AgBiI6/Fa0.75Cs0.25SnI3/HTL/Ag dual absorber-based heterojunction structure to improvise the power conversion efficiency of Cs2AgBiI6-based single-absorber PSCs. The proposed configuration employs dual perovskite absorber layers (PALs) consisting of wide band gap Cs2AgBiI6 (1.6 eV) as the top absorber layer along with narrow bandgap Fa0.75Cs0.25SnI3 (1.27 eV) to act as the bottom absorber layer. Before evaluating the bilayer configuration, two standalone PSC architectures, namely, ITO/ETL/Fa0.75Cs0.25SnI3/HTL/Ag (D1)- and ITO/ETL/Cs2AgBiI6/HTL/Ag (D2)-based PSC have been simulated and computed to perfectly fit the earlier anticipated state of art results. After effective validation of the photovoltaic parameters of the standalone architectures, both the absorber layers are appraised to constitute a dual active layer configuration ITO/ETL/Cs2AgBiI6/Fa0.75Cs0.25SnI3/HTL/Ag (D3) maintaining the overall absorber layer width constant to elevate the overall solar cell efficiency. Herein, a combination of various competent hole transport layers (HTLs) such as CBTS, CFTS, Cu2O, CuI, CuO, CuSCN, P3HT, PEDOT:PSS, and Spiro-OMeTAD, as well as electron transport layers (ETLs) like C60, CeO2, IgZo, PCBM, TiO2, WS2, and ZnO, are adopted and compared to attain highly efficient bilayer PSC configuration. The crucial variables of all ETL- and HTL-based proposed bilayer solar cell configurations including the thickness of PALs, the width of the carrier transport layers, defect densities of transport layers, the effect of operating temperature, series, and shunt resistances have been extensively optimized and tuned to attain preeminent photovoltaic power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and quantum efficiencies (QEs). It has been well evinced that the proposed configuration with dual-absorber layers could effectively widen the light absorption regime to the near-infrared range and thus significantly contribute toward enhanced photovoltaic performance. The simulation results attained with SCAPS showcase the outstanding performance of the proposed dual active layer solar structure obtained with the combination of CuSCN HTL and TiO2 ETL pair. The work concludes a 35.01\% optimized efficient ITO/TiO2/Cs2AgBiI6(PAL-2)/Fa0.75Cs0.25SnI3(PAL-1)/CuSCN/Ag bilayer solar cell configuration with enhanced short circuit current density (Jsc) of 32.24 mA/cm2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.273 V, and 85.31\% fill factor (FF) with 0.6- and 0.8-μm PAL-1 and PAL-2 width respectively and 1014-cm−3 defect density under AM1.G solar spectrum illumination with 1000-W/m2 light power density. The proposed eco-friendly solar structure will also help in providing power backup to the next-generation communication units and devices. Notably the dual-absorber structure integrating Cs2AgBiI6 and Fa0.75Cs0.25SnI3 materials demonstrates significant advantages in quantum efficiency and spectral coverage compared to using either material independently as single absorbers. The proposed model achieves a peak efficiency of approximately 93\% across a spectral range of 300–975 nm, surpassing the 90\% efficiency obtained with a single Cs2AgBiI6 absorber covering 300–700 nm. Moreover, it exceeds the 89\% efficiency achieved by the single Fa0.75Cs0.25SnI3 absorber within the 300- to 974.5-nm spectral range. Solar cells play a pivotal role in ensuring the sustainability, reliability, and cost efficiency of powering wireless nodes, especially in remote or environmentally sensitive areas where traditional power sources may be inadequate or unavailable. The proposed PSC, with a PCE of 35.01\%, can generate 350.1 watts under standard test conditions. This provides sufficient power to support approximately 70 wireless nodes, including wireless sensor nodes, IoT devices, and others, each consuming approximately 5 watts of power.",[N],N/A
Re-Evaluating Acceptable Intake: A Comparative Study of N-Nitrosomorpholine and N-Nitroso Reboxetine Potency,"Zhang, Shaofei and Cheung, Jennifer and Kostal, Jakub and Voutchkova-Kostal, Adelina and Schuler, Maik",2025.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/em.70007,Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/em.70007,,"ABSTRACT Establishing regulatory limits for Drug Substance-Related Impurities (NDSRIs) is challenging due to the limited genotoxicity and carcinogenicity data available for many of these impurities, often leading to conservative approaches. In this study, we evaluated the genotoxic potential of two structurally related nitrosamines: N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) and N-nitroso reboxetine. Compared to the well-studied NMOR, there is little toxicological information available for N-nitroso reboxetine. Currently, both compounds have an acceptable intake value of 127 ng/day, based on a read-across using the available carcinogenicity data of NMOR. While both compounds tested positive in a series of in vitro and in vivo assays, we found that the mutagenic potential of N-nitroso reboxetine was significantly lower than that of NMOR. The benchmark dose (BMD) analysis of in vivo mutagenicity data supports an acceptable intake of 24,000 ng/day for N-nitroso reboxetine. Computational studies, carried out using the quantum-mechanical CADRE program, were consistent with in vitro and in vivo outcomes, suggesting an acceptable intake at or above 1500 ng/day for N-nitroso reboxetine. In comparison to NMOR, this prediction is supported by lower computed reactivity in the hydroxylation step, greater steric hindrance of the alpha carbons, and more facile proton transfer in the heterolysis toward the aldehyde metabolite. The data presented in this work can be used to refine and improve the Carcinogenic Potency Categorization Approach (CPCA). It also underscores the importance of collaboration between regulatory authorities, the pharmaceutical industry, and scientific researchers to address potential risks while avoiding overestimation of the acceptable intake limits for certain NDSRIs.",[N],N/A
Using N-Nitrosodiethanolamine (NDELA) and N-Nitrosopiperidine (NPIP) Transgenic Rodent Gene Mutation Data and Quantum Mechanical Modeling to Derive Potency-Based Acceptable Intakes for NDSRIs Lacking Robust Carcinogenicity Data,"Roper, Jason M. and Griffin, Troy R. and Johnson, George E. and Kostal, Jakub and Nudelman, Raphael and Ott, Gregory R. and Voutchkova-Kostal, Adelina and Niddam-Hildesheim, Valerie",2025.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/em.70012,Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/em.70012,,"ABSTRACT Acceptable intake (AI) limits for nitrosamine drug substance related impurities (NDSRIs) that lack carcinogenicity data could be estimated from mutagenic potency relative to anchor nitrosamines with carcinogenicity data. This approach integrates points of departure (PoDs) derived from in vivo mutagenicity studies with in silico predictions generated by a validated quantum-mechanical (QM) model. N-nitrosodiethanolamine (NDELA) and N-nitrosopiperidine (NPIP), with AIs derived from robust carcinogenicity data, were tested in the transgenic rodent (TGR) gene mutation assay. Liver mutant frequency and benchmark dose (BMD) modeling provided a suitable, robust, and precise PoD metric. BMD confidence intervals (CIs) calculated from mutant frequency expanded the potency range of previously reported BMD CIs for other anchor nitrosamines. Cancer-protective AIs for mutagenic NDSRIs can be pragmatically calculated on a potency basis by comparing their lower bound TGR BMD CIs with the BMD CIs and AIs derived from model/anchor nitrosamines that have results for in vivo gene mutation and cancer bioassays. In vivo modeling was supported by the Computer-Aided Discovery and RE-design (CADRE) program, a validated QM model for predicting NDSRI carcinogenic potency based on the underlying mechanism of mutagenicity. CADRE distinguished between anchor nitrosamines N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and the less potent NDELA and NPIP. Scrutiny of underlying reactivity indices and relevant physicochemical properties rationalized the observed trend in metabolic activity and thus predicted carcinogenic potency. Leveraging the in vivo–in silico approach is valuable in gaining confidence in the proposed AIs, whereby the QM model serves as mechanistic validation of in vivo results.",[N],N/A
Monolithic Tandem Solar Cell With Co-Sensitized DSSC and Perovskite Sub-Cells Using Spectral Filtering for High-Efficiency Photon Management,"Dey, Diptanu and Chakraborty, Raj and Das, Punam and Das, Diptanu and Ghosh, Pronob K.",2025.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/eng2.70409,Engineering Reports,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eng2.70409,,"ABSTRACT Recent advances in dye-sensitized and perovskite solar technologies have enabled tandem architectures to surpass single-junction efficiency limits. This work reports a high-efficiency monolithic tandem solar cell combining a co-sensitized dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) top sub-cell with a triple-cation perovskite bottom sub-cell. The DSSC, based on a mesoporous TiO2 photoanode co-sensitized with SM315 and ZnTPP dyes, harvests light from 400 to 650 nm. The bottom cell, using a Cs/FA/MA mixed-halide perovskite, targets near-infrared photons (650–850 nm). A dielectric multilayer optical filter facilitates spectral splitting, while a thin indium tin oxide recombination layer ensures efficient series connection and current matching. Under calibrated dual-LED illumination (∼125 mW/cm2), the tandem achieved a lab-measured power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 33.7\%, with a simulated maximum of ∼36.8\% and an average reproducible PCE of 33.2\% ± 0.4\% (n = 3). When tested under a class AAA AM1.5G solar simulator (100 mW/cm2), the device produced a baseline PCE of 27.1\% (short-circuit current density, JSC = 16.1 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage, VOC = 1.95 V, fill factor, FF = 0.72). These values are in-house laboratory results, not certified records. UV–Vis, FTIR, external quantum efficiency, and EIS confirmed effective charge transport and spectral complementarity. Surface and interface morphology were characterized by AFM, SEM, and HRTEM. Stability testing showed > 96\% retention after 500 h at 25°C and ∼86\% at 60°C. Outdoor field testing under tropical weather confirmed functional robustness.

Photon energy amplification for the design of a micro PV panel,"Hossain, Md.

Because the Higgs-Boson BR (H → γγ¯) Quantum can be excited under high temperature conditions which forms extremely short-range week force by the photon-photon collusion of the bare ions; thus, a pair photon (e+e−) is created from a single photon. This pair of photon can be dissociated by 2 surface semiconductors of the photovoltaic panel and further dispersed by the 3 diodes superconducting silicon surface to form multiple photons, here named as Hossain Multiple Photons (HmP¯). A mathematical test has been performed by applying MATLAB software, which revealed that production of HmP¯ [1photon = (1 + 1 = 2photons) = (2photons + 2photons)2surface = 16photon = (16photons)3diode = ∑4,096photons] from a single phone is doable through photon-photon collusion, photon dissociation, and photon scattering process into the Higgs-Boson BR (H → γγ¯) quantum field under high temperature condition. These multiple photons can be converted from direct current into alternating current for commercial use. Calculation revealed that 1590.9 MW/h clean energy can be produced by merely 1 cm2 PV panel which indeed would be a new field of science that will substantially satisfy the total global energy demand.",[N],N/A
Stability study of large-area perovskite solar cells fabricated with copper as low-cost metal contact,"Samantaray, Manas R. and Rana, Naba Kr. and Kumar, Arun and Ghosh, Dhriti S. and Chander, Nikhil",2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/er.7243,International Journal of Energy Research,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/er.7243,,"Summary Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising technology for next-generation photovoltaic devices because of their ease of fabrication and high power conversion efficiency (PCE). The main obstacle that limits the commercialization of large-area PSCs is the lack of suitable solution-processable low-temperature fabrication methods and the perovskite material's chemical stability. With an increase in the active area of the cell, the defect states and the series resistance of the device increase, which is undesirable. We have demonstrated a repeatable fabrication method of small (0.25 cm2) and large (2.0 cm2) active area devices with Au and Cu as back contact electrodes. Small area perovskite devices with Cu and Au contact electrodes showed a PCE of 9.87\% and 10.42\%, respectively. When scaled up to 2.0 cm2, the devices showed a minor drop in the open-circuit voltage, but a significant decrease in photocurrent was observed. Large-area PSCs with Cu and Au contacts displayed a PCE of 5.61\% and 5.92\%, respectively. External quantum efficiency measurements at four different points provided similar results, thus confirming the uniformity of large-area devices. The stability of large-area devices under ambient environment conditions was tested for more than 7 weeks. Gold-based PSC retained almost 75\% of its initial PCE when stored in ambient conditions for 50 days, whereas Cu-based devices showed a significant decrease in efficiency in the same period. Degradation in efficiency of PSCs occurred primarily due to the loss in photocurrent arising from active layer degradation. Simulations of perovskite devices carried out using Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS)-1D software also showed that similar efficiencies of PSCs may be obtained using Cu, instead of Au, as the low-cost metal contact. Novelty Statement Large-area perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on gold and copper metal contacts have been fabricated, and copper contacts provide efficiencies comparable with the values obtained with gold contacts. The study shows that copper can be used as a low-cost alternative to gold to fabricate large-area, high-efficiency PSCs. Stability testing under ambient conditions has been carried out for 50 days to compare the performance of gold- and copper-based large-area PSCs.",[N],N/A

These tools are user-friendly, but they provide a very rough (and sometimes misleading) estimation of the NMR properties, especially for complex systems. Rigorous and reliable ways to predict and interpret NMR properties of simple and complex systems are available in many popular computational program packages. Nevertheless, experimentalists keep relying on these “unreliable” tools in their daily work because, to have a sufficiently high accuracy, these rigorous quantum mechanical methods need high levels of theory. An alternative, efficient, semi-empirical approach has been proposed by Bally, Rablen, Tantillo, and coworkers. This idea consists of creating linear calibrations models, on the basis of the application of different combinations of functionals and basis sets. Following this approach, the predictive capability of a wider range of popular functionals was systematically investigated and tested.

Conversely, due to its antisymmetric character, CD cannot be directly applied to the matrix representation of the spatial part of the two-electron spin-orbit coupling (2e-SOC) integrals. Here, we present a computational strategy to achieve a Cholesky representation of the spatial part of the 2e-SOC integrals, and propose a new efficient CD algorithm for both ERI and 2e-SOC integrals. The proposed algorithm differs from previous CD implementations by the extensive use of a full-pivoting design, which allows a univocal definition of the Cholesky basis, once the CD δ threshold is made explicit. We show that is the upper limit for the errors affecting the reconstructed 2e-SOC integrals. The proposed strategy was implemented in the ab initio program Computational Emulator of Rare Earth Systems (CERES), and tested for computational performance on both the ERI and 2e-SOC integrals evaluation. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",[N],N/A

We present new features, including the link atom scheme, which allows the modeling of QM regions as a part of bigger molecules. Benchmark tests on various systems, including QM water in water, amino acids in water, and tripeptides validate the reliability of the new functionalities. Performance evaluations demonstrate that the updated implementation is efficient, with the primary computational burden attributed to the QM program rather than the QM/MM interface or the MD program itself. The improved QM/MM interface enables more advanced investigations into biomolecular reactivity, enzyme catalysis, and other phenomena requiring detailed quantum mechanical treatment within classical simulations. This work represents a significant advancement in the capabilities of GROMOS, providing enhanced tools to explore complex molecular systems.",[N],N/A

Multiple linear regressions, partial least squares (PLS), and partial component regression (PCR) models combined with genetic algorithm (GA) were constructed as variable selection methods by using molecular descriptors to investigate the potential relationship between the selected descriptors and the retention times of the enantiomers. The molecular descriptors were generated from the molecular structure of enantiomers and calculated by the DRAGON software. Besides 504 DRAGON descriptors, additional 38 quantum mechanical descriptors were obtained using density functional theory/B3LYP/6-31G method. Then, the results of the obtained models were compared with MIA descriptors that are pixels of two-dimensional (2D) chemical structures. MIA descriptors were analyzed by correlation ranking-PCR and PLS methods. The predictive ability of the models was evaluated using cross-validation and an external test set. The results showed that GA is a good method for variable selection using structural descriptors combined with the PLS model. Since MIA descriptors are 2D pixels of the chemical structures, they can differentiate between the (R) and (S) isomers of enantiomers better than the quantum mechanical and structural descriptors. Comparison between the different models indicated that the GA-PLS and MIA-PLS models were the best methods.",[N],N/A

Experiments were carried out in a shock tube measuring time variation of CO concentrations, in a flow tube measuring product concentrations, and in a rapid compression machine (RCM) measuring ignition delay times. The detailed reaction mechanism was constructed using the Reaction Mechanism Generator software. Sensitivity and flux analyses were used to identify key rate and thermochemical parameters, which were then computed using quantum chemistry to improve the mechanism. Validation of the final model against the 1–20 bar 600–1500 K experimental data is presented with a discussion of the kinetics. The model is in excellent agreement with most of the shock tube and RCM data. Strong non-monotonic variation in conversion and product distribution is observed in the flow-tube experiments as the temperature is increased, and unusually strong pressure dependence and significant heat release during the compression stroke is observed in the RCM experiments. These observations are largely explained by a close competition between radical decomposition and addition to at different sites in MPE; this causes small shifts in conditions to lead to big shifts in the dominant reaction pathways. The validated mechanism was used to study the chemistry occurring during ignition in a diesel engine, simulated using Ignition Quality Test (IQT) conditions. At the IQT conditions, where the MPE concentration is higher, bimolecular reactions of peroxy radicals are much more important than in the RCM.",[N],N/A
Perspective on automated predictive kinetics using estimates derived from large datasets,"Green, William H.",2024.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/kin.21744,International Journal of Chemical Kinetics,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/kin.21744,,"Abstract A longstanding project of the chemical kinetics community is to predict reaction rates and the behavior of reacting systems, even for systems where there are no experimental data. Many important reacting systems (atmosphere, combustion, pyrolysis, partial oxidations) involve a large number of reactions occurring simultaneously, and reaction intermediates that have never been observed, making this goal even more challenging. Improvements in our ability to compute rate coefficients and other important parameters accurately from first principles, and improvements in automated kinetic modeling software, have partially overcome many challenges. Indeed, in some cases quite complicated kinetic models have been constructed which accurately predicted the results of independent experiments. However, the process of constructing the models, and deciding which reactions to measure or compute ab initio, relies on accurate estimates (and indeed most of the numerical rate parameters in most large kinetic models are estimates.) Machine-learned models trained on large datasets can improve the accuracy of these estimates, and allow a better integration of quantum chemistry and experimental data. The need for continued development of shared (perhaps open-source) software and databases, and some directions for improvement, are highlighted. As we model more complicated systems, many of the weaknesses of the traditional ways of doing chemical kinetic modeling, and of testing kinetic models, have been exposed, identifying several challenges for future research by the community.",[N],N/A

In this paper, a novel hybrid algorithm is proposed and applied in the docking environment of AutoDock version 4.2.6 in order to enhance the accuracy and the efficiency for dockings with flexible ligands. This search algorithm, called entropy-based Lamarckian quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (ELQPSO), is a combination of the QPSO with an entropy-based update strategy and the Solis and Wet local search (SWLS) method. By using the PDBbind core set v.2016, the ELQPSO is compared with the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA), Lamarckian particle swarm optimization (LPSO) and Lamarckian QPSO (LQPSO). The experimental results reveal that the corresponding docking program of ELQPSO, named as EQDOCK in this paper, has a competitive performance in dealing with the protein-ligand docking problems. Moreover, for the test cases with different number of torsions, the EQDOCK outperforms the other three docking programs in finding docking conformations with small root mean squared deviation (RMSD) values in most cases. In particular, it has an advantage of solving highly flexible ligand docking problems over the others.",[N],N/A

Quantum-inspired algorithm for radiotherapy planning optimization,"Pakela, Julia M. and Tseng, Huan-Hsin and Matuszak, Martha M. and Ten Haken, Randall K. and McShan, Daniel L. and El Naqa, Issam",2020.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.13840,Medical Physics,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mp.13840,,"Purpose Modern inverse radiotherapy treatment planning requires nonconvex, large-scale optimizations that must be solved within a clinically feasible timeframe. We have developed and tested a quantum-inspired, stochastic algorithm for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT): quantum tunnel annealing (QTA). By modeling the likelihood probability of accepting a higher energy solution after a particle tunneling through a potential energy barrier, QTA features an additional degree of freedom (the barrier width, w) not shared by traditional stochastic optimization methods such as Simulated Annealing (SA). This additional degree of freedom can improve convergence rates and achieve a more efficient and, potentially, effective treatment planning process. Methods To analyze the character of the proposed QTA algorithm, we chose two stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) liver cases of variable complexity. The “easy” first case was used to confirm functionality, while the second case, with a more challenging geometry, was used to characterize and evaluate the QTA algorithm performance. Plan quality was assessed using dose-volume histogram-based objectives and dose distributions. Due to the stochastic nature of the solution search space, extensive tests were also conducted to determine the optimal smoothing technique, ensuring balance between plan deliverability and the resulting plan quality. QTA convergence rates were investigated in relation to the chosen barrier width function, and QTA and SA performances were compared regarding sensitivity to the choice of solution initializations, annealing schedules, and complexity of the dose-volume constraints. Finally, we investigated the extension from beamlet intensity optimization to direct aperture optimization (DAO). Influence matrices were calculated using the Eclipse scripting application program interface (API), and the optimizations were run on the University of Michigan's high-performance computing cluster, Flux. Results Our results indicate that QTA’s barrier-width function can be tuned to achieve faster convergence rates. The QTA algorithm reached convergence up to 46.6\% faster than SA for beamlet intensity optimization and up to 26.8\% faster for DAO. QTA and SA were ultimately found to be equally insensitive to the initialization process, but the convergence rate of QTA was found to be more sensitive to the complexity of the dose-volume constraints. The optimal smoothing technique was found to be a combination of a Laplace-of-Gaussian (LOG) edge-finding filter implemented as a penalty within the objective function and a two-dimensional Savitzky–Golay filter applied to the final iteration; this achieved total monitor units more than 20\% smaller than plans optimized by commercial treatment planning software. Conclusions We have characterized the performance of a stochastic, quantum-inspired optimization algorithm, QTA, for radiotherapy treatment planning. This proof of concept study suggests that QTA can be tuned to achieve faster convergence than SA; therefore, QTA may be a good candidate for future knowledge-based or adaptive radiation therapy applications.",[N],N/A

The development of an absorber layer, transparent conducting oxide window layer, and module design was the key focus. This permitted 1.8\% higher efficiency than our last experimental result. The quantity and the injection time of the sodium were controlled, resulting in higher open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current (Jsc). In order to increase Jsc, we changed the thickness of the window layer. Boron-doped zinc oxide was optimized for higher transmittance without reducing the fill factor. The uniformity of each layer was improved, and patterns were optimized for each module. Therefore, Voc, Jsc, and FF could be theoretically improved on the reported results of, respectively, 20 mV, 2 mA/cm2, and 1.4\%. The module's efficiency was measured at the Korea Test Laboratory to compare with the data obtained in-house. Various analyses were performed, including secondary ion mass spectroscopy, photoluminescence, quantum efficiency, solar simulator, and UV–vis spectrometry, to measure the cell's depth profile, carrier lifetime, external quantum efficiency, module efficiency, and transmittance, respectively.

Colloidal quantum dot solar cell power conversion efficiency optimization using analysis of current-voltage characteristics and electrode contact imaging by lock-in carrierography,"Hu, Lilei and Liu, Mengxia and Mandelis, Andreas and Melnikov, Alexander and Sargent, Edward H.",2017.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/pip.2920,Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pip.2920,,"Abstract Although the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of colloidal quantum dot solar cells (CQDSCs) has increased sharply, researchers are struggling with the lack of comprehensive device efficiency optimization strategies, which retards significant progress in CQDSC improvement. This paper addresses this critical issue through analyzing the impact of colloidal quantum dot (CQD) carrier hopping mobility, bandgap energy, illumination intensity, and electrode/CQD interface on device performance to develop a guiding criterion for CQDSC PCE optimization. This general strategy has been used for the successful fabrication of high-efficiency CQDSCs yielding certified PCEs as high as 11.28 \%. A major experimental finding of this work is that the widely used constant photocurrent density (Jph) assumption is invalid as Jph is external-voltage dependent due to the low carrier hopping mobility. Furthermore, the theoretical model developed herein predicts the nonmonotonic dependence of CQDSC PCE on carrier hopping mobility and bandgap energy, which were also demonstrated with the high-efficiency CQDSCs. These results constitute a revision basis of the widespread belief that higher mobility and lower bandgap energy correspond to a higher CQDSC efficiency. Furthermore, electrode/CQD interface-dependent surface recombination velocities were investigated in the framework of our abovementioned theoretical model using lock-in carrierography, a contactless, large-area frequency-domain photocarrier diffusion-wave imaging methodology that elucidated the carrier collection process at the electrodes through open-circuit voltage distribution imaging. Lock-in carrierography eliminates the limitations of today's widely used small-spot (<0.1 cm2) testing methods which, however, raise questionable overall solar cell performance and stability estimations.",[N],N/A
Comprehensive study of potential-induced degradation in silicon heterojunction photovoltaic cell modules,"Yamaguchi, Seira and Yamamoto, Chizuko and Ohdaira, Keisuke and Masuda, Atsushi",2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/pip.3006,Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pip.3006,,"Abstract Accelerated tests were used to study potential-induced degradation (PID) in photovoltaic (PV) modules fabricated from silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells containing tungsten-doped indium oxide (IWO) transparent conductive films on both sides of the cells and a rear-side emitter. A negative bias of −1000 V was applied to a module with respect to the cover glass surface in a chamber maintained at 85°C, which significantly reduced the cell's short-circuit current density (Jsc) within several days. Based on dark current density-voltage and external quantum efficiency measurements, the reduction in the Jsc was attributed to optical losses rather than carrier recombination. X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy showed the formation of metallic indium (In) in the IWO layers of a degraded cell, which suggests that the root cause of the optical loss was a darkening of the front IWO layers caused by the precipitation of metallic In. In extremely severe PID tests, the SHJ PV modules exhibited not only a further reduction in the Jsc but also a moderate reduction in the open-circuit voltage (Voc). These Jsc and Voc reductions were probably caused by sodium being introduced into the base region of the cells. A comparison of the PID test results of the SHJ PV modules with those of other types of PV modules indicates that SHJ PV modules have a relatively high resistance to PID. As a module with an ionomer encapsulant exhibited little degradation, their high resistances to PID may be further improved by using encapsulants with high electrical resistances.",[N],N/A
Elucidating potential-induced degradation in bifacial PERC silicon photovoltaic modules,"Luo, Wei and Hacke, Peter and Terwilliger, Kent and Liang, Tian Shen and Wang, Yan and Ramakrishna, Seeram and Aberle, Armin G. and Khoo, Yong Sheng",2018.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/pip.3028,Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pip.3028,,"Abstract This paper elucidates the behavior and underlying mechanism of potential-induced degradation (PID) on the rear side of p-type monocrystalline silicon bifacial passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) photovoltaic modules. At 50°C, 30\% relative humidity, and −1000 V bias to the solar cells with aluminium foil on the rear glass surface, the rear-side performance of bifacial PERC modules at standard testing conditions degraded dramatically after 40 hours with a 40.4\%, 36.2\%, and 7.2\% loss in maximum power (Pmpp), short-circuit current (Isc), and open-circuit voltage (Voc), respectively. The front-side standard testing condition performance, on the other hand, showed less degradation; Pmpp, Isc, and Voc dropped by 12.0\%, 5.2\%, and 5.3\%, respectively. However, negligible degradation was observed when the solar cells were positively biased. Based on I-V characteristics, electroluminescence, external quantum efficiency measurements, and the effective minority-carrier lifetime simulation, the efficiency loss is shown to be caused by the surface polarization effect; positive charges are attracted to the passivation/antireflection stack on the rear surface and reduce its field effect passivation performance. Extended PID testing to 100 hours showed an increase in device performances (relative to 40 hours) due to the formation of an inversion layer along the rear surface. In addition, replacing ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer with polyolefin elastomer films significantly slows down the progression of PID, whereas a glass/transparent backsheet design effectively protects the rear side of bifacial PERC modules from PID. Furthermore, PID on the rear side of bifacial PERC modules is fully recoverable, and light greatly promotes recovery of the observed PID.",[N],N/A

Five encapsulated PV cells were circulated to participants for being tested at Standard Test Conditions (STC). Three cells were a-Si/μc-Si tandem PV devices, each of which had a different short-circuit current ratio between the top junction and the bottom one; the remaining two cells were single-junction PV devices made with material representative of the individual junctions in the MJ cells. The RR PT's main purpose was to assess the capability of the participating laboratories, in terms of employed facilities and procedures, to test MJ PV devices. Therefore, participants were requested to perform STC measurements of all cells according to their own procedure, which might not include external quantum efficiency measurements. The European Solar Test Installation (ESTI) of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) provided the reference calibrations against which the participants' results are compared. ESTI made also a verification of the cells performance at STC at the end of the RR PT, in order to allow a comparison between the initial stable state at which the cells were calibrated (just before circulation) and the one they had reached at the end of the RR PT. The overall results of the RR PT are here presented and discussed together with some aspects of MJ PV testing that emerged as not adequately applied or largely missing.

Recover possibilities of potential induced degradation caused by the micro-cracked locations in p-type crystalline silicon solar cells,"Nguyen, Dong C. and Ishikawa, Yasuaki and Uraoka, Yukiharu",2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/pip.3383,Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pip.3383,,"Abstract Potential induced degradation (PID) has been affecting the performance, durability, and reliability of crystalline Si solar cells/modules. The authors demonstrate that micro-cracks also act as the additional recombination centers, which reduce short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and the effective lifetime of carriers in solar cells, in PID condition. This hypothesis was confirmed by external quantum efficiency measurements and microwave photo-conductance decay method at the micro-cracked areas before and after PID stress tests. In addition, the PID recovery was made significantly but non-fully for the laminated micro-cracked modules owing to the electrical PID recovery method. In addition, the authors showed and discussed the challenging problems in recovering the performance of the PID-affected micro-cracked solar modules without lamination. The achieved results from 11 cycles of PID stress/recovery tests with the same duration of PID stress and recovery processes showed that an exponentially decreasing function fits the correlation between the relative losses of Pmax, Voc, fill factor (FF), and Jsc due to the PID stress process and the number of the PID stress/recovery cycles. This provides a model for the estimation of the relative losses of Pmax, Voc, FF, and Jsc due to the PID stress process versus the number of the PID stress/recovery cycles. Finally, based on the decreasing tendency in the performance loss of the PID-affected laminated micro-cracked solar modules after PID stress/recovery cycles, the authors suggest that cyclic PID tests with suitable conditions might be a reasonable approach to control PID.",[N],N/A

There is evidence via lab studies that some of these cells are more susceptible to UV induced degradation (UVID), yet there is a lack of confirmation that such degradation occurs in the field. Current IEC standards designed to screen for early module failures require only minimal UV exposure (15 kWh/m2 280–400 nm, ~2–3 months equivalent outdoor exposure). Here, we investigate fielded n-PERT silicon (Si) modules from a commercial utility that show power losses of ~2\%/year. We present a comprehensive picture of the physics and chemistry of degradation supported by both module and cell electronic characterization (EL, PL, IV, EQE, and DLIT) and materials-level morphological and chemical analysis (SEM, EDS, XPS, FTIR, and HPLC). All sampled site modules show short circuit current (Isc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) losses when compared to unfielded spares, with the most severely degraded also having losses in fill factor (FF). We identify two different degradation modes contributing to overall power loss: (1) external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements show losses in the blue range of the spectra, indicative of cell surface recombination losses, and (2) variations in high series resistance (Rs) at the cell level that are correlated with compositional differences in cell metallization. Using unfielded spares, we were able to reproduce Voc, Isc, and EQE losses via a minimum UV stress of 67.5 kWh/m2 (280–400 nm), 4.5× the exposure currently required in IEC 61215-2 (MQT 10). Degradation continued with additional UV dosage equivalent to the fielded modules (405 kWh/m2 total), with power loss leveling out at an average of 6.1\%. Subsequent 1000 h of 85\% RH/85°C damp heat testing showed that cells exposed to UV underwent additional severe series resistance degradation, even those without the susceptible paste composition seen in the field, whereas non-UV exposed cells saw little change. We attribute this to higher concentrations of acetic acid generated on the UV exposed area of the module, leading to degradation of the gridline/cell interface and high Rs. This study is unique in that it reproduces field observed utility scale UVID with an accelerated test and supports the need for standards development for longer UV exposure combined with other stress factors to catch materials interplay within a module package.",[N],N/A

Other QM packages will be added in future releases. The main advantage of gmx2qmmm is its simplicity in terms of input setup and configuration as it maintains the Gromacs file formats, as well as input conventions. It is also designed such that users do not need to reconfigure or recompile any of the interfaced programs. While our main goal was to provide a simplified transition from Gromacs to QM/MM using Gromacs directly as the basis for the MM part, we considered alternative ways to treat the QM/MM boundary. Our software was also developed to test a previously considered way to account for the presence of link atoms, which we term here link atom correction functions (LCFs). We show that LCFs can be good candidates to improve the forces at the QM/MM junction; however, from our data, it is also apparent that LCFs will not necessarily improve energy barriers, likely due to them being tailored to improve the situation close to potential minima. LCFs are, however, trivial to set up and can be used in the future to support the accuracy of QM/MM optimizations and dynamics.

Qubit unitary coupled cluster with generalized single and paired double excitations ansatz for variational quantum eigensolver,"Xie, Qing-Xing and Zhang, Wen-gang and Xu, Xu-Sheng and Liu, Sheng and Zhao, Yan",2022.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/qua.27001,International Journal of Quantum Chemistry,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qua.27001,,"Abstract Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) with a unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz has been suggested as a promising method for electronic structure calculations on future quantum computers. However, the complexity of the excitation terms for UCC with the single and double excitations (UCCSD) ansatz is up-bounded to OM−N2N2, where N is the number of electrons and M is the number of spin orbitals. The gate complexity of quantum circuit for the UCCSD ansatz is up-bounded to OMM−N2N2 using the Jordan–Wigner transformation. These complexities significantly limit the implementation of UCCSD on current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Herein, we developed a k-QUpCCGSD ansatz which is based on the generalized paired double excitation operators and the particle preserving exchange gate. The former reduces the number of the excitation operators, the latter reduces the number of qubit gates for transforming excitation operators to quantum circuit. The gate complexity of the proposed k-QUpCCGSD ansatz is up-bounded to O(kM2), which significantly reduce the complexity of the VQE algorithm on NISQ devices. The performance of the proposed ansatz on VQE is demonstrated by calculating ground-state dissociation energy curves of the H6, LiH, H2O, and BeH2 molecules with the STO-3G minimal basis set, and the accuracy is evaluated by comparing to the full configuration interaction (FCI) benchmarks. Moreover, we compare the number of quantum gates, especially the CNOT gates, and accuracies of various ansatzes. The assessments have shown that the accuracy of qubit unitary coupled cluster (QUCC) ansatzes is slightly worse than that of the UCC ones, but the circuit complexity of QUCC is much less than that of UCC. Among the tested QUCC ansatzes, k-QUpCCGSD achieves higher accuracy with fewer quantum gates than QUCCSD, and k-QUpCCGSD is a promising ansatz for VQE calculation on NISQ devices.",[N],N/A

However, direct implementation of quantum circuits significantly increases the hardware resource utilization and system latency of classical emulators. In this paper, we investigate multiple implementation models alternative to conventional emulation approaches, as feasible solutions to the scalability problem in classical emulation of quantum circuits. In the first model, the quantum circuit functionality is reduced to equivalent, arithmetic (multiply-and-accumulate) operations and combined with two computation methods, based on lookup and dynamic generation. In the second model, a kernel operation is extracted from the quantum circuit based on its functionality, and the kernel is iterated through all input quantum states. The proposed emulation models provide space and time optimizations, significantly reducing resource utilizations and latencies and improving scalability. We use these models to develop a highly scalable hardware emulator that is based on reconfigurable technology for efficient simulations of full quantum algorithms and circuits. Our hardware implementations support single precision floating point arithmetic for improved accuracy, and contain fully pipelined designs for high throughput. We investigate quantum algorithms such as quantum Fourier transform and quantum wavelet transform and explore different hardware architectures and optimizations. Experimental results and analysis are provided for the architectures in terms of resource consumption and emulation time.

Then the hypothesis—that is, the SEnM can effectively simulate a general circuit model of QC—is tested by introducing an information-theoretic inequality, named readout inequality. The inequality is satisfied by the SEnM and imposes a critical condition: if the hypothesis holds, the inequality should be satisfied by the probing model of QC.

These quantities can also be related to solving linear systems of equations. This study presents three related algorithms for calculating transition probabilities. First, a previously published short-depth algorithm is extended, allowing for the two input states to be non-orthogonal. Building on this first procedure, a higher-depth algorithm based on Trotterization and Richardson extrapolation is derived that requires fewer circuit evaluations. Third, a tunable algorithm that allows for trading off circuit depth and measurement complexity is introduced, yielding an algorithm that can be tailored to specific hardware characteristics. Finally, proof-of-principle numerics are presented for models in physics and chemistry and for a subroutine in variational quantum linear solving (VQLS). The primary benefits of these approaches are that a) arbitrary non-orthogonal states may now be used with small increases in quantum resources, b) they (like another recently proposed method) entirely avoid subroutines such as the Hadamard test that may require three-qubit gates to be decomposed, and c) in some cases fewer quantum circuit evaluations are required as compared to the previous state-of-the-art in NISQ algorithms for transition probabilities.",[N],N/A

A popular strategy for solving multi-class classification problems involves first transforming the problem into many binary classification problems. However, this requires the number of binary classification models that need to be developed to grow with the number of classes. Recent work in quantum machine learning has seen the development of multi-class quantum classifiers that circumvent this growth by learning a mapping between the data and a set of label states. This work presents the first multi-class SWAP-Test classifier inspired by its binary predecessor and the use of label states in recent work. With this classifier, the cost of developing multiple models is avoided. In contrast to previous work, the number of qubits required, the measurement strategy, and the topology of the circuits used is invariant to the number of classes. In addition, unlike other architectures for multi-class quantum classifiers, the state reconstruction of a single qubit yields sufficient information for multi-class classification tasks.

The SFQ pulse pairs are then combined and wave-shaped by using a microwave combining filter, which finally outputs desired microwave signals with narrow line-width. The amplitude of the microwave signal correlates with the interval between two SFQ pulses in a pair and can be adjusted accordingly. To validate the proposal, test chips are fabricated and performed experiments. The experimental results confirm that the method using a reverse-polarity pulse can maximize the output microwave amplitude and provide control of the initial phase of the output microwave. This improvement offers a superior alternative for generating microwaves using superconducting circuits to control quantum bits.",[N],N/A

Based on the analysis, a necessary and sufficient condition is provided to uniquely identify the target state under noisy measurements. Moreover, this work proposes a symmetric hypothesis testing verification algorithm with noisy measurements. Then, relying on \$W\$ states, a semidefinite program is demonstrated to calculate the infidelity threshold for arbitrary measurement noise.

In this work, a feature selection method is proposed with a specific focus on QML. This scheme treats the light-cones (i.e., subspace) of quantum models as features and then select relevant ones through training of the corresponding local quantum kernels. Its versatility is numerically demonstrated for four different applications using toy tasks: (1) feature selection of classical inputs, (2) circuit architecture search for data embedding, (3) compression of quantum machine learning models and (4) subspace selection for quantum data.

Our proposed technique introduces a novel formulation of the action space based on a sampling scheme and a progressive widening technique to explore the space dynamically. When testing our MCTS approach on the domain of random quantum circuits, MCTS approximates unstructured circuits under different values of stabilizer Rényi entropy. It turns out that MCTS manages to approximate the benchmark quantum states independently from their degree of nonstabilizerness. Next, our technique exhibits robustness across various application domains, including quantum chemistry and systems of linear equations. Compared to previous MCTS research, our technique reduces the number of quantum circuit evaluations by a factor of 10 up to 100 while achieving equal or better results.

Advanced encryption standard (AES) is widely used in satellite communication due to its robustness and efficiency. However, conventional AES implementations focus primarily on encryption and decryption, which require further improvements in attack resilience, particularly against adversaries that use machine learning–based cryptanalysis and quantum threats. This paper examines the use of AES algorithms to protect data transmission over satellite communications. It introduces novel modifications to AES, incorporating machine unlearning as a defensive mechanism against attacks, chaotic injection for enhanced key unpredictability, and a quantum-inspired approach based on wavefunction collapse to mislead attackers. Machine unlearning dynamically alters cryptographic states upon intrusion detection, preventing key recovery. Chaotic injection is explored in the S-Box and key scheduling process to introduce controlled unpredictability without compromising reversibility. Additionally, a quantum circuit representation of AES is proposed, where an adversarial attack induces a wavefunction collapse, leading to incorrect but deterministic outputs. Performance evaluation under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) conditions demonstrates that the proposed AES achieves an average encryption throughput of 194 Mbps with only 3.2\% additional computational overhead, whereas entropy analysis shows 7.85–7.92 bits/byte, with an improvement of 1.08\% over standard AES and expanding the effective key space by approximately 6.6 times. Comparative security testing shows a 25\% increase in resistance to differential attacks. Empirical machine learning attacks demonstrate a drop in classifier accuracy from approximately 92.3\% for the baseline AES to 55.5\% for the proposed scheme. These results confirm that the proposed modifications significantly strengthen AES while maintaining computational efficiency for real-world satellite communication scenarios.",[N],N/A

To successfully design a quantum system, it is necessary to appropriately address the increasing complexity which exists in the development procedure of the system. A suitable approach to deal with this problem is to employ systems engineering models and integrate them with domain engineering tools. The model-based systems engineering (MBSE) methodology is commonly used to analyze, design, manufacture, and test various complex systems. In this paper, the MBSE approach is chosen for the development of quantum dot solar cells as a typical quantum system and to deal with the complexity existing in this procedure. The analysis, manufacturing, and verification, validation, and testing (VV\&T) for this system are described using SysML in Cameo Systems Modeler software to represent the role of models in this regard. Then a detailed design is performed in MATLAB and integrated with SysML to identify how changing various parameters during the system development process affects the overall system performance. This technique facilitates the communication between different engineering teams and helps to manage the complexity in the entire system lifecycle.",[N],N/A

Generally, the errors of relative energies due to local approximations can be reduced to below 1 kcal/mol. The methods are well parallelized, and using small computer clusters with 100–200 computing cores, calculations for systems with 100–200 atoms using augmented triple-ζ basis sets can be carried out within a few hours of elapsed time.

Theoretical study of excitation energy transfer and nonlinear spectroscopy of photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes using the nonperturbative reduced dynamics method,"Yan, Yaming and Liu, Yanying and Xing, Tao and Shi, Qiang",2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/wcms.1498,WIREs Computational Molecular Science,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wcms.1498,,"Abstract The highly efficient excitation energy transfer (EET) processes in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes have attracted much recent research interests. Experimentally, spectroscopic studies have provided important information on the energetics and EET dynamics. Theoretically, due to the large number of degrees of freedom and the complex interaction between the pigments and the protein environment, it is impossible to simulate the whole system quantum mechanically. Effective Hamiltonian models are often used, in which the most important degrees of freedom are treated explicitly and all the other degrees of freedom are treated as a thermal bath. However, even with such simplifications, solving the real-time quantum dynamics could still be a difficult task. A particular challenging case in simulating the EET dynamics and related spectroscopic phenomena lies in the so-called intermediate coupling regime, where the intermolecular electronic couplings and the electronic–vibrational couplings are of similar strength. In this article, we review theoretical studies of linear and nonlinear spectroscopic signals of photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes, using the nonperturbative hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach. Simulations were performed for the EET dynamics, various types of linear spectra, two-dimensional electronic spectra, and pump–probe spectra. Benchmark tests of several approximate methods related to the HEOM approach were also discussed. The results show that the nonperturbative HEOM approach is an effective method in simulating the EET dynamics and spectroscopic signals of photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes. Important insights into EET pathways, quantum effects including quantum delocalization, and quantum coherence in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes were also obtained through such simulations.

AQME has a modular structure of independent modules that can be implemented in any sequence, allowing the users to use all or only the desired parts of the program. The code has been developed for researchers with basic familiarity with the Python programming language. The CSEARCH module interfaces to molecular mechanics and semi-empirical QM (SQM) conformer generation tools (e.g., RDKit and Conformer–Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool, CREST) starting from various initial structure formats. The CMIN module enables geometry refinement with SQM and neural network potentials, such as ANI. The QPREP module interfaces with multiple QM programs, such as Gaussian, ORCA, and PySCF. The QCORR module processes QM results, storing structural, energetic, and property data while also enabling automated error handling (i.e., convergence errors, wrong number of imaginary frequencies, isomerization, etc.) and job resubmission. The QDESCP module provides easy access to QM ensemble-averaged molecular descriptors and computed properties, such as NMR spectra. Overall, AQME provides automated, transparent, and reproducible workflows to produce, analyze and archive computational chemistry results. SMILES inputs can be used, and many aspects of tedious human manipulation can be avoided.

However, present quantum processing units (QPUs) are still subject to large errors. Therefore, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware is limited in terms of qubit counts/circuit depths. Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithms can potentially overcome such issues. Here, we introduce the OpenVQE open-source QC package. It provides tools for using and developing chemically-inspired adaptive methods derived from unitary coupled cluster (UCC). It facilitates the development and testing of VQE algorithms and is able to use the Atos Quantum Learning Machine (QLM), a general quantum programming framework enabling to write/optimize/simulate quantum computing programs. We present a specific, freely available QLM open-source module, myQLM-fermion. We review its key tools for facilitating QC computations (fermionic second quantization, fermion-spin transforms, etc.). OpenVQE largely extends the QLM's QC capabilities by providing: (i) the functions to generate the different types of excitations beyond the commonly used UCCSD ansatz; (ii) a new Python implementation of the “adaptive derivative assembled pseudo-Trotter method” (ADAPT-VQE). Interoperability with other major quantum programming frameworks is ensured thanks to the myQLM-interop package, which allows users to build their own code and easily execute it on existing QPUs. The combined OpenVQE/myQLM-fermion libraries facilitate the implementation, testing and development of variational quantum algorithms, while offering access to large molecules as the noiseless Schrödinger-style dense simulator can reach up to 41 qubits for any circuit. Extensive benchmarks are provided for molecules associated to qubit counts ranging from 4 to 24.

In this paper we test QCBM performance on a dataset of spot FX log-returns (heavy-tailed distribution) as well as specially constructed mixture of Normal distributions (which models spiky light-tailed distribution). The QCBM has greater expressive power than comparable classical neural networks such as restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and, therefore, has potential to demonstrate quantum advantage by generating high-quality samples from the learned empirical distribution of the market risk factors while using less computational resources than its classical counterpart. However, efficient training of QCBM remains a challenging problem. Traditional differentiable learning approach may not work well when the loss function is highly non-smooth. In such cases it may be more efficient to use the non-differentiable learning methods. This paper proposes a non-differentiable learning approach to the training of QCBM based on genetic glgorithm (GA).

The development began at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) in 2005, and the manufacturing and testing of all the receivers to be installed in the 66 Cassegrain reflector antennas that compose ALMA was completed in 2013. This enabled the terahertz frequency observations with the highest sensitivity from the ground. To meet the stringent ALMA requirements, terahertz SIS mixers with high-quality superconducting NbTiN films were developed, which successfully demonstrated an unpreceded noise performance less than 230 K (5 times the quantum noise) for all the receivers. After the construction of ALMA, NAOJ began development studies for ALMA enhancement such as wideband and multibeam SIS receivers according to top-level science requirements. To increase instantaneous bandwidth of the receivers, a submillimeter-wave multiband receiver concept with a waveguide multiplexer, wideband intermediate frequency SIS-mixer-amplifier, and multifrequency local oscillator (LO) source is presented. The multibeam receiver employs a planar-integrated SIS mixer circuit that includes all the RF components except the LO distribution network and an SIS-mixer-based amplifier of low power consumption, which is expected to enable the wide field-of-view observations in the future.",[N],N/A

The obtained results demonstrated that the convergence is achieved more quickly by the EWPSO than other optimization algorithms based on QPSO. A lumped element equivalent circuit was designed to model the terminal impedance of a broadband planar sinuous antenna in the frequency range from 1 to 3 GHz.

The operation of quantum technologies is based on the manipulation of the quantum states of certain devices, either to induce transitions between states or to detect the transitions. Irrespective of the practical realization of these quantum devices, their manipulation requires interacting with their quantum resonant states, for which very narrow radio-frequency (RF) bursts in the range of the GHz are required. Arbitrary waveform generators are used to generate these signals for test purposes, but this is not suitable for practical quantum technology applications, which will need to produce the required bursts by specific circuit building blocks with low power and small dimensions.

In this research, we propose a heuristic adaptive quantum routing (RWTA\_AQR) algorithm for routing, wavelength and timeslot assignment. RWTA\_AQR utilises the FirstFit algorithm to assign wavelengths in both contiguous and noncontiguous timeslots for optimal resource utilisation based on the priority. To verify its effectiveness, the proposed RWTA\_AQR is tested on NSFNET and UBN24 network topologies under diversified traffic models, towards low as well as high demand, network congestion scenarios. We use network security performance (NSP), success ratio of connection requests, timeslot utilisation, quantum key utilisation, blocking probability (BP) and security downgrade ratio as metrics to prove its effectiveness against the existing methods based on flexible security level, strict security level and classical approach. The results demonstrate that RWTA\_AQR performs better by allowing NSP of up to 90\% and having the lowest BP (below 10\%) at lower traffic load. The proposed solution provides a systematic trade-off in security and resource utilisation with controlled overhead for improving the performance of QKD-SDONs in dynamic resource-constrained environments.",[N],N/A

A novel use of water-soluble CdSe Quantum Dots capped with GSH for Minute Virus of Mice prototype genome labeling,"Rivera, Joel and Arroyo, Shirley Ann and Diffoot-Carlo, Nanette",2019.0,https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2019.33.1\_supplement.635.18,The FASEB Journal,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2019.33.1_supplement.635.18,,"Viruses can infect the host's cell through different mechanisms. Nevertheless, studies have shown that the viral entry pathway more common of viruses that affect humans is the interaction between glycoproteins of the envelope with receptors in the host's cell membrane. For many years, studies have tried to use fluorescent proteins to understand the mechanisms of a single viral particle, but it has not been effective because in order to emit fluorescence, strong enough to be detected, the viral particle must have many of the fluorescent proteins attached and these can alter the invasion of the host cell. Additionally, some do not have an envelope, and therefore for these types of viruses, the fluorescent proteins are not effective. To solve this problem, we are substituting fluorescent proteins for quantum dots (QDs). These QDs are made from different inorganic compounds that have shown to produce more fluorescence than the protein without requiring the use of many of them. This means that these QDs can help study the mechanisms of infection of a single viral particle. These particles are unstable in aqueous solution, and it can cause the production of toxic molecules for the cell. This obstacle has led new research in how one can modify the synthesis or the compound to make a more stable and effective QDs. In this research, we used a proposed protocol for the synthesis of QDs in a direct aqueous solution to obtain a more stable particle. Additionally, to make the QDs more stable for biological applications, we conjugated glutathione (GSH) to these particles. The GSH allowed the QDs to enter the cell and interact with the genome of the virus used for this study, the minute virus of mice (MVMp). Furthermore, we used the cell line MDA-MB-231 as a model to test our experimental approach. This study will help better understand the mechanisms of infection of a single MVMp particle. Additionally, it will open doors to study how this particle can be conjugated with other molecules such as DNA and encapsulated for gene therapy of different diseases.

The three probes presented here redistribute according to transmembrane voltage, pH or high cholesterol lipid domains. We have successfully used them to image mitochondria, lysosome/acidic endosomes and Golgi apparatus in multiple live mammalian cell lines as well as fungi including Candida biofilms by confocal microscopy. Compared to some of the most popular commercial probes, our probes possess several advantages: 1) they utilize the increasingly available but little used 405 nm laser for excitation yet due to a large Stokes shift can be visualized with green filter sets such as those used with GFP, 2) they equilibrate rapidly (seconds to minutes) with target organelles and respond rapidly to changing conditions such as mitochondrial depolarization, 3) they are extremely chemically stable and photostable allowing long-term monitoring of live cell organelles and 3D confocal imaging as well as having a long shelf life, 4) they have low toxicity toward mammalian and fungal cells and, 5) they have high quantum yields with little self quenching allowing for quantitative and qualitative imaging in complete culture media with minimal interference from background and autofluorescence. These probes have the potential to be very useful in long-term microscopic cell biology studies and other methods using live cells such as flow cytometry.

So far, such reconstruction methods for 1-RDM, not constrained to idempotency, have been tested only on a toy model system (CO2). In this work, a new method is assessed on crystalline urea [CO(NH2)2] using static (0 K) and dynamic (50 K) artificial experimental data. An improved model, including symmetry constraints and frozen core-electron contribution, is introduced to better handle the increasing system complexity. Reconstructed 1-RDMs, deformation densities and DCP anisotropy are analysed, and it is demonstrated that the changes in the model significantly improve the reconstruction quality, even when there is insufficient information and data corruption. The robustness of the model and the strategy are thus shown to be well adapted to address the reconstruction problem from actual experimental scattering data.",[N],N/A

Traditional manual inspections are labor-intensive, costly, and subject to subjective bias, while classical machine learning models demand extensive computational resources for large-scale evaluations. These challenges have driven growing interest in quantum computing, which theoretically offers increased computational efficiency and the potential to process high-dimensional data with fewer parameters compared to classical approaches. This study investigates the feasibility and performance of Hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Models (HQCCMs) specifically designed for infrastructure image classification. Two distinct HQCCMs are proposed: the Parallel Angle-Encoded Hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Model (PA-HQCCM) and the Single Amplitude-Encoded Hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Model (SA-HQCCM). The core novelty of these hybrid architectures lies in the effective integration of quantum convolutional layers, classical convolutional operations, and parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) into a unified framework, enabling the models to leverage the inherent compactness and representational efficiency of quantum feature extraction. Experimental results reveal that HQCCMs achieve a test accuracy improvement of approximately 3.0\% beyond comparable classical CNN baselines, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Comprehensive ablation studies quantify the distinct advantages delivered by the quantum components, while generalization capabilities are assessed by unseen images. The study further examines the influence of measurement strategies, quantum noise, and circuit configurations on model performance, offering valuable insights into optimizing HQCCMs. Overall, these findings underscore the transformative potential of quantum-enhanced architectures in resource-constrained environments, offering a scalable, image-driven tool for rapid pavement condition screening.",[N],N/A

Methods: Ninety-three patients who received lung SBRT at our clinic from 2011–2013 were retrospectively identified. Planning information was acquired for each patient, from which various features were extracted using in-house semi-automatic software. Anatomic features included tumor-to-OAR distances, tumor location, total-lung-volume, GTV and ITV. Dosimetric endpoints were adopted from RTOG-0195 recommendations, and consisted of various OAR-specific partial-volume doses and maximum point-doses. First, PCA analysis and unsupervised quantum-clustering was used to explore the feature-space to identify potentially strong classifiers. Secondly, a multi-class logistic regression algorithm was developed and trained to predict dose-volume endpoints based on patient-specific anatomic features. Classes were defined by discretizing the dose-volume data, and the feature-space was zero-mean normalized. Fitting parameters were determined by minimizing a regularized cost function, and optimization was performed via gradient descent. As a pilot study, the model was tested on two esophageal dosimetric planning endpoints (maximum point-dose, dose-to-5cc), and its generalizability was evaluated with leave-one-out cross-validation. Results: Quantum-Clustering demonstrated a strong separation of feature-space at 15Gy across the first-and-second Principle Components of the data when the dosimetric endpoints were retrospectively identified. Maximum point dose prediction to the esophagus demonstrated a cross-validation accuracy of 87\%, and the maximum dose to 5cc demonstrated a respective value of 79\%. The largest optimized weighting factor was placed on GTV-to-esophagus distance (a factor of 10 greater than the second largest weighting factor), indicating an intuitively strong correlation between this feature and both endpoints. Conclusion: This pilot study shows that it is feasible to predict dose-volume endpoints based on patient-specific anatomic features. The developed methodology can potentially help to identify patients at risk for higher OAR doses, thus improving the efficiency of treatment planning. R01-184173",[N],N/A

This verification provides a measure of confidence that the files can be used directly as part of a more extensive intensity modulated radiation therapy / volumetric modulated arc therapy QA program. Methods: Initial testing used white paper placed at the collimator plane and a standard hand-held digital camera to image the light and shadow of a static MLC field through the paper. Known markings on the paper allow for image calibration. Noise reduction was attempted with removal of ‘inherent noise’ from an open-field light image through the paper, but the method was found to be inconsequential. This is likely because the environment could not be controlled to the precision required for the sort of reproducible characterization of the quantum noise needed in order to meaningfully characterize and account for it. A multi-scale iterative edge detection algorithm was used for localizing the leaf ends. These were compared with the planned locations from the treatment console. Results: With a very basic setup, the image of the central bank A leaves 15–45, which are arguably the most important for beam modulation, differed from the planned location by [0.38±0.28] mm. Similarly, for bank B leaves 15–45 had a difference of [0.42±0.28] mm Conclusion: It should be possible to determine leaf position accurately with not much more than a modern hand-held camera and some software. This means we can have a periodic and independent verification of the dynalog file information. This is indicated by the precision already achieved using a basic setup and analysis methodology. Currently, work is being done to reduce imaging and setup errors, which will bring the leaf position error down further, and allow meaningful analysis over the full range of leaves.",[N],N/A

Each function was tested on the same set of 16 protein-ligand complexes. For exhaustive low-energy minima search the novel MPI parallelized docking program FLM and large supercomputer resources were used. Protein-ligand binding energies calculated using low-energy minima were compared with experimental values. It was demonstrated that the docking target function on the base of the MMFF94 force field in vacuo can be used for discovery of native or near native ligand positions by finding the low-energy local minima spectrum of the target function.

In today’s competitive markets, using green technologies remains vital. In the present project, we have examined a class of closed-loop supply chain competitive facility location-routing problems. According to the framework of the competition, one of the players, called the Leader, opens its facilities first. The second player, called the Follower, makes its decision when Leader’s location is known. Afterwards, each customer chooses an open facility based on some preference huff rules before returning the benefits to one of the two companies. The follower, under the influence of the leader’s decisions, performs the best reaction in order to obtain the maximum capture of the market.

In this research contribution, computational analysis using SCAPS-1D software is performed to explore the output photovoltaic parameters of a Sb2S3-based solar cell with h-ETL. No theoretical works on this configuration have been previously reported. The main objectives of the present work are to propose a h-ETL with good band alignment with the Sb2S3 absorber, high transparency, and Cd free; to mitigate the instability and cost issues associated with using Spiro-OMeTAD HTL; and to optimize the solar cell. Thus, we calibrated the J-V characteristics and electrical parameters of the FTO/(ZnO/TiO2)/Sb2S3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au solar cell by numerical simulation and compared them with those of the experiment. Subsequently, our simulations show that to replace the TiO2 ETL used in the experiment and to form the h-ETL with ZnO, IGZO is found to be a good candidate. It has better band alignment with the Sb2S3 absorber than TiO2 ETL, which reduces the trap states at the ETL/Sb2S3 interface; it has high transparency due to its wide bandgap; and an intense electric field is generated at the IGZO/Sb2S3 interface, which reduces the recombination phenomenon at this interface. MoO3, MASnBr3, Cu2O, CuI, and CuSCN HTL were also tested to replace the Spiro-OMeTAD HTL. Simulation results show that the cell with MoO3 HTL achieves higher performance due to its high hole mobility and high quantum efficiency in the visible region; it also allows the solar cell to have better thermal stability (TC = −0.32\%/K) than the cell with Spiro-OMeTAD HTL (TC = −0.53\%/K). The parameters that could improve the solar cell efficiency (η) obtained after these substitutions were also optimized. In particular, the parameters of the Sb2S3 absorber layer (thickness, defect density, and doping), ETL and HTL layer thicknesses, h-ETL/Sb2S3 interface defect density, and series and shunt resistances have been optimized. Finally, by combining high performance and thermal stability, the results show that the thermal stability of the solar cell depends on the back contact type; thus, nickel (Ni) was found to combine high performance and better thermal stability among the back contacts investigated. After these improvements, the efficiency of the Sb2S3-based solar cell increased from 5.08\% (JSC = 16.19 mA/cm2, VOC = 0.56 V, and FF = 55.40\%) to 15.43\% (JSC = 18.51 mA/cm2, VOC = 1.11 V, and FF = 74.76\%). This study proposes an approach to optimize the Sb2S3 upper subcell for tandem solar cells.",[N],N/A

Parameter optimization of software reliability growth model with S-shaped testing-effort function using improved swarm intelligent optimization,"Jin, Cong and Jin, Shu-Wei",2016.0,10.1016/j.asoc.2015.11.041,APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING,,,"Software reliability growth model (SRGM) with testing-effort function (TEF) is very helpful for software developers and has been widely accepted and applied. However, each SRGM with TEF ( SRGMTEF) contains some undetermined parameters. Optimization of these parameters is a necessary task. Generally, these parameters are estimated by the Least Square Estimation (LSE) or the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). We found that the MLE can be used only when the software failure data to satisfy some assumptions such as to satisfy a certain distribution. However, the software failure data may not satisfy such a distribution. In this paper, we investigate the improvement and application of a swarm intelligent optimization algorithm, namely quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, to optimize these parameters of SRGMTEF. The performance of the proposed SRGMTEF model with optimized parameters is also compared with other existing models. The experiment results show that the proposed parameter optimization approach using QPSO is very effective and flexible, and the better software reliability growth performance can be obtained based on SRGMTEF on the different software failure datasets.

To harness quantum computers’ real potential in software applications, one needs to have an in-depth understanding of all such characteristics of quantum computing platforms (QCPs), relevant from the Software Engineering (SE) perspective.

Improved novel bat algorithm for test case prioritization and minimization,"Bajaj, Anu and Sangwan, Om Prakash and Abraham, Ajith",2022.0,10.1007/s00500-022-07121-9,SOFT COMPUTING,,,"Regression testing is essential for continuous integration and continuous development. It is needed to ensure that the modifications have not produced any errors or faults, thereby maintaining the quality and reliability of the software. The testers usually avoid exhaustive retesting because it requires lots of effort and time. The test case prioritization and minimization solve the issue by scheduling the critical test cases and removing redundant ones. Optimization techniques help by improving the efficiency of these techniques while utilizing limited resources. This paper proposed an enhanced discrete novel bat algorithm for the test case prioritization. The algorithm is modified in two ways. First, we have proposed a fix-up mechanism for the discrete combinatorial problem, which conducts the perturbation in the population using the asexual reproduction algorithm. Second, the novel bat algorithm is improved, where the bats hunt in different habitats with quantum behavior using Gaussian distribution and search in the limited habitat with Doppler effect. In addition, we have embedded the test case minimization procedure in the algorithm for redundancy reduction. The experimental results are empirically analyzed using different testing criteria, i.e., fault and statement coverage on three subject programs from the software infrastructure repository. Consequently, test selection percentage, coverage loss, fault detection loss, and cost reduction percentages are deduced for the test case minimization at program and version levels. Empirical results and statistical comparisons with the random search, bat algorithm, novel bat algorithm, birds swarm algorithm, whale optimization algorithm, and genetic algorithm show the outperformance of the proposed algorithm.",[N],N/A
Design of classical-quantum systems with UML,"Perez-Castillo, Ricardo and Piattini, Mario",2022.0,10.1007/s00607-022-01091-4,COMPUTING,,,"Developers of the many promising quantum computing applications that currently exist are urging companies in many different sectors seriously consider integrating this new technology into their business. For these applications to function, not only are quantum computers required, but quantum software also. Accordingly, quantum software engineering has become an important research field, in that it attempts to apply or adapt existing methods and techniques (or propose new ones) for the analysis, design, coding, and testing of quantum software, as well as playing a key role in ensuring quality in large-scale productions. The design of quantum software nevertheless poses two main challenges: the modelling of software quantum elements must be done in high-level modelling languages; and the need to further develop so-called hybrid information systems, which combine quantum and classical software. To address these challenges, we first propose a quantum UML profile for analysing and designing hybrid information systems; we then demonstrate its applicability through various structural and behavioural diagrams such as use case, class, sequence, activity, and deployment. In comparison to certain other quantum domain-specific languages, this UML profile ensures compliance with a well-known international standard that is supported by many tools and is followed by an extensive community.",[N],N/A

It is essential in the software development process and needs a huge quantity of resources such as labor, money, and time. Automated software testing can be used to save manual work, shorten testing times, and improve testing performance. Recently, Software Bug Prediction (SBP) models have been developed to improve the software quality assurance (SQA) process through the prediction of bug parts. Advanced deep learning (DL) models can be used to classify faults in software parts. Because hyperparameters have a significant impact on the performance of any DL model, a proper hyperparameter optimization approach utilizing metaheuristic methods is required. This paper provides a unique Metaheuristic Optimization with Deep Learning based SBP (MODL-SBP) methodology to ensure software dependability and trustworthiness. The suggested technique entails creating a hybrid Convolution Neural Network (CNN) bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) to forecast software problems. Furthermore, the Chaotic Quantum Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (CQGOA) is used for hyperparameter optimization of the CNN-BiLSTM models, which enhances predictive accuracy.

However, similar to classical computing, to fully exploit QC's potential, it is important to ensure the correctness of quantum programs. Doing so via software testing is, however, very challenging because of QC's inherent properties: superposition and entanglement. Towards the direction of ensuring the correctness of quantum programs, we propose an approach called QuCAT (QUantum CombinAtorial Testing) for systematic and automated testing of quantum programs by benefiting from combinatorial testing, which has been proven to be cost-effective in testing classical programs. QuCAT supports two combinatorial test suite generation scenarios, i.e., generating combinatorial test suites of a given strength, and incrementally generating and executing combinatorial test suites of increasing strength until a fault is found. The approach employs two types of test oracles to assess test results. We performed an empirical study with 18 faulty versions of quantum programs to evaluate QuCAT with strengths of two, three, and four in the two test generation scenarios. We compare the cost-effectiveness of combinatorial testing of various strengths and random testing (taken as baseline approach). Results show that combinatorial testing always performs better than random testing with the same cost and finds faults more quickly (in terms of required number of test cases). In addition, in most cases, combinatorial testing with a higher strength outperforms the lower strength in terms of effectiveness.",[Y],[Y]

Such a difference may cause difficulties or misunderstandings for developers shifting from classical programming to quantum programming. To understand the impact of quantum noise on quantum programs and its implications for software developers, we conduct a series of studies with real-world quantum programs and quantum computing environments. Specifically, we first measure and analyze the noise in a real quantum computer by testing it with a basic quantum program. We find that a non-neglectable amount of quantum noise generally exists in real quantum computers. Then we investigate the robustness of quantum programs against different quantum noises by testing 18 real -world quantum programs and 50,000 randomly generated quantum circuits in simulated and real environments. We observe that quantum noise can significantly influence the correctness of quantum programs, and different quantum circuit structures show diverse sensitivity patterns under the same noise.

Mitigating Noise in Quantum Software Testing Using Machine Learning,"Muqeet, Asmar and Yue, Tao and Ali, Shaukat and Arcaini, Paolo",2024.0,10.1109/TSE.2024.3462974,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10682972,IEEE Press,"Quantum Computing (QC) promises computational speedup over classic computing. However, noise exists in near-term quantum computers. Quantum software testing (for gaining confidence in quantum software's correctness) is inevitably impacted by noise, i.e., it is impossible to know if a test case failed due to noise or real faults. Existing testing techniques test quantum programs without considering noise, i.e., by executing tests on ideal quantum computer simulators. Consequently, they are not directly applicable to test quantum software on real quantum computers or noisy simulators. Thus, we propose a noise-aware approach (named $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN) to alleviate the noise effect on test results of quantum programs. $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN employs machine learning techniques (e.g., transfer learning) to learn the noise effect of a quantum computer and filter it from a program's outputs. Such filtered outputs are then used as the input to perform test case assessments (determining the passing or failing of a test case execution against a test oracle). We evaluated $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN on IBM's 23 noise models, Google's two available noise models, and Rigetti's Quantum Virtual Machine, with six real-world and 800 artificial programs. We also generated faulty versions of these programs to check if a failing test case execution can be determined under noise. Results show that $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN can reduce the noise effect by more than $80\%$80% on most noise models. We used an existing test oracle to evaluate $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN's effectiveness in quantum software testing. The results showed that $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN attained scores of $99\%$99%, $75\%$75%, and $86\%$86% for precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively, for the test oracle across six real-world programs. For artificial programs, $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN achieved scores of $93\%$93%, $79\%$79%, and $86\%$86% for precision, recall, and F1-score respectively. This highlights $\mathit{QOIN}$QOIN's effectiveness in learning noise patterns for noise-aware quantum software testing.",[Y],[Y]
Mutation Testing of Quantum Programs: A Case Study With Qiskit,"Fortunato, Daniel and CAMPOS, JOSÉ and ABREU, RUI",2022.0,10.1109/TQE.2022.3195061,IEEE Transactions on Quantum Engineering,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9844849,IEEE Press,"As quantum computing is still in its infancy, there is an inherent lack of knowledge and technology to test a quantum program properly. In the classical realm, mutation testing has been successfully used to evaluate how well a program's test suite detects seeded faults (i.e., mutants). In this article, building on the definition of syntactically equivalent quantum operations, we propose a novel set of mutation operators to generate mutants based on qubit measurements and quantum gates. To ease the adoption of quantum mutation testing, we further propose QMutPy, an extension of the well-known and fully automated open-source mutation tool MutPy. To evaluate QMutPy's performance, we conducted a case study on 24 real quantum programs written in IBM's Qiskit library. Furthermore, we show how better test suite coverage and improvements to test assertions can increase the test suites' mutation score and quality. QMutPy has proven to be an effective quantum mutation tool, providing insight into the current state of quantum tests and how to improve them.",[Y],[Y]
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for Test Case Optimization,"Wang, Xinyi and Ali, Shaukat and Yue, Tao and Arcaini, Paolo",2024.0,10.1109/TSE.2024.3479421,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,,,"Test case optimization (TCO) reduces the software testing cost while preserving its effectiveness. However, to solve TCO problems for large-scale and complex software systems, substantial computational resources are required. Quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOAs) are promising combinatorial optimization algorithms that rely on quantum computational resources, with the potential to offer increased efficiency compared to classical approaches. Several proof-of-concept applications of QAOAs for solving combinatorial problems, such as portfolio optimization, energy optimization in power systems, and job scheduling, have been proposed. Given the lack of investigation into QAOA's application for TCO problems, and motivated by the computational challenges of TCO problems and the potential of QAOAs, we present IGDec-QAOA to formulate a TCO problem as a QAOA problem and solve it on both ideal and noisy quantum computer simulators, as well as on a real quantum computer. To solve bigger TCO problems that require many qubits, which are unavailable these days, we integrate a problem decomposition strategy with the QAOA. We performed an empirical evaluation with five TCO problems and four publicly available industrial datasets from ABB, Google, and Orona to compare various configurations of IGDec-QAOA, assess its decomposition strategy of handling large datasets, and compare its performance with classical algorithms (i.e., Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Random Search). Based on the evaluation results achieved on an ideal simulator, we recommend the best configuration of our approach for TCO problems. Also, we demonstrate that our approach can reach the same effectiveness as GA and outperform GA in two out of five test case optimization problems we conducted. In addition, we observe that, on the noisy simulator, IGDec-QAOA achieved similar performance to that from the ideal simulator. Finally, we also demonstrate the feasibility of IGDec-QAOA on a real quantum computer in the presence of noise.",[N],N/A

Regression testing ensures that software works as expected after changes are implemented. However, re-executing all test cases for every modification is often impractical and costly, particularly for large systems. Although very effective, traditional test suite optimization techniques are often impractical in resource-constrained scenarios, as they are computationally expensive. Hence, quantum computing solutions have been developed to improve their efficiency, but have shown drawbacks in terms of effectiveness. We propose reformulating the regression test case selection problem to use quantum computation techniques better. Our objectives are (i) to provide more efficient solutions than traditional methods and (ii) to improve the effectiveness of previously proposed quantum-based solutions. We propose SelectQA, a quantum annealing approach that can outperform the quantum-based approach BootQA in terms of effectiveness while obtaining results comparable to those of the classic Additional Greedy and DIV-GA approaches.

Despite its rapid advancement, this field is still in its early stages and lacks essential software engineering principles such as resilience and customisability by design. To provide developers with a quantum technology stack that embeds these principles by design, we propose leveraging the heterogeneity of existing quantum computers. Specifically, we introduce a novel distribution methodology, termed shot-wise, to distribute the quantum computation workload of a single circuit execution (i.e., its shots) across multiple quantum computers. This shot-wise methodology is highly customisable, allowing for the em-bedding of user-specific and scenario-specific requirements into the distribution process. Requirements can be expressed through constraints, such as the geographical location of the QPUs, and their architecture, or ensuring or avoiding specific combinations of QPUs and quantum providers. Additionally, requirements can be defined by one or more objective functions to be minimised or maximised, such as reducing waiting time, computation cost, or energy footprint. By also combining constraints and objective functions, our shot-wise methodology enhances flexibility and improves the overall resilience of quantum computations against potential quantum computer failures. Preliminary results indicate that this approach offers error rates comparable to, or lower than, those of single-device execution even in all the tested scenarios with different numbers of qubits, families of circuits and number of QPUs to distribute the shots.",[N],N/A

Recently, some open-source benchmarks and mutation analysis tools have emerged. However, there is insufficient evidence on how various quantum circuit characteristics (e.g., circuit depth, number of quantum gates), algorithms (e.g., Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm), and mutation characteristics (e.g., mutation operators) affect the detection of mutants in quantum circuits. Studying such relations is important to systematically design faulty benchmarks with varied attributes (e.g., the difficulty in detecting a seeded fault) to facilitate assessing the cost-effectiveness of quantum software testing techniques efficiently. To this end, we present a large-scale empirical evaluation with more than 700K faulty benchmarks (quantum circuits) generated by mutating 382 real-world quantum circuits. Based on the results, we provide valuable insights for researchers to define systematic quantum mutation analysis techniques. We also provide a tool to recommend mutants to users based on chosen characteristics (e.g., a quantum algorithm type) and the required difficulty of detecting mutants.
